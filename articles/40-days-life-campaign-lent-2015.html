<h1>40 Days for Life Campaign Begins 10 February</h1>
<p>The Lent/spring 40 Days for Life campaign in 2016 begins February 10 and will end March 20. You can help save lives by praying and fasting in support of 40 Days for Life volunteers who will be standing in prayerful vigil outside of abortion clinics in countries all over the world.</p>
<p>God has provided many blessings through past 40 Days for Life campaigns. Since 2007, 3,588 individual campaigns have taken place in 579 cities in 30 nations across the world and 650,000 volunteers have joined together in this historic display of unity, prayer and fasting for an end to abortion.</p>
<p>40 Days For Life has succeeded in shutting down 60 abortion facilities, and has documented saving at least 10,331 babies. In addition to the babies, 118 abortion workers have quit their jobs and walked away from the abortion industry and thousands of women have been spared the suffering and trauma that comes with the decision to abort one’s own child.</p>
<p>40 Days for Life is a community-based campaign that draws attention to the evil of abortion through the use of a three-point program:</p>
<p><strong>Prayer and fasting</strong>: Christ told us some demons can only be driven out by prayer and fasting. The two go hand in hand. Prayer keeps us rooted in the fact that it is our desire to carry out God’s will. Fasting is a sacrifice that helps us reach beyond our own limitations with God’s help. Fasting is not a Christian diet; it is a form of physical prayer. You can fast from food, TV, alcohol … anything that separates you from God.</p>
<p><strong>Constant vigil</strong>: The most visible component of 40 Days for Life is a constant prayer vigil – 24 hours a day, seven days a week – outside a place where children are aborted. It is a prayerful witness to the clinic’s patients and employees, and to the entire community, that evil is in our midst and that with God’s help, it will be defeated.</p>
<p><strong>Community outreach</strong>: During 40 Days for Life, the pro-life message is proactively taken to the community. A door-to-door petition and education drive reaches out. Informational flyers can raise awareness about abortion. Church involvement, media contact and campus outreach also contribute.</p>
<p>The 40-day campaign tracks Biblical history, where God used 40-day periods to transform individuals, communities and the entire world. From Noah in the flood to Moses on the mountain to the disciples after Christ’s resurrection, it is clear that God sees the transformative value of His people accepting and meeting a 40-day challenge.</p>
<p>The mission of the campaign is to bring together the body of Christ in a spirit of unity during a focused 40-day campaign of prayer, fasting, and peaceful activism, with the purpose of repentance, to seek God’s favor to turn hearts and minds from a culture of death to a culture of life, thus bringing an end to abortion.</p>

<p>“<em>A great prayer for life is urgently needed, a prayer which will rise up throughout the world. Through special initiatives and in daily prayer, may an impassioned plea rise to God, the Creator and lover of life, from every Christian community, from every group and association, from every family and from the heart of every believer.</em>– Pope John Paul II, The Gospel of Life (Evangelium Vitae), n. 100.</p>

<p><strong>PRAYERS from Priests for Life</strong> (<a href="http://www.priestsforlife.org/" target="_blank">www.priestsforlife.org</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong>: O God of Beginnings, You are the Creator of all life. As we begin this week, be near us as we unite with our pre-born brothers and sisters who are scheduled for death. May you by your Holy Spirit and by the voice of your church lead your people to rescue from death the innocent children and bring those who participate in their death to true repentance that they may taste of your goodness and mercy; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen</p>
<p><strong>Monday</strong>: Almighty and Powerful God, drive all evil spirits away from the innocent pre-born children and from the killing centers where their destruction is planned. Overcome evil with good in the hearts of those who reject your truth and who have believed the lies of the evil one who would say that good is evil and evil is good. Rebuke the enemy for the sake of innocent children and for your sake, O Lord; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday</strong>: O Great King of Kings, let your kingdom come on earth as it is in heaven for the sanctity of all human life. You have said that your Kingdom is righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. Where there is unrighteousness let righteousness come to bear, where there is hostility, cause your peace to reign supreme, where there is sorrow, bring joy in the hearts of people. Lead us into your unshakable and everlasting kingdom in which you reign forever and ever, so that truly the kingdoms of this world will become the Kingdom of our God; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday</strong>: O God of mercy and grace, as you hung on the hard wooden Cross, you asked that those who were putting you to death might be forgiven. Please, O Lord, help us to offer that same forgiveness to those who participate in abortion, euthanasia, the destruction of embryonic life and who by other means violate the sanctity of human life, that in all things the world would know the height, the depth, the breadth, and width of your love, your mercy and your grace; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen</p>
<p><strong>Thursday</strong>: O Holy God, our Rock and our Fortress, you used the womb of Mary to be a tabernacle for the dwelling of the Incarnation, where the Holy Son of God was to be nurtured and protected. You created the womb of woman that the miracle of human life might be nurtured and protected. Many women have been deceived to believe that their womb is not a place of holy protection for a human life, but that it is simply another appendage of their body. Renew and restore your purpose and will concerning the womb of all women throughout the earth, that you may be glorified; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong>: O Ruler of the nations, many of the kings of the earth have set themselves against you; they rebel against your rule. Yet you have set your King on your holy hill of Zion so that in every local, state, provincial and national government you may rule in the midst of your enemies. We pray that you will strengthen and uphold those rulers that, by your grace, are following your ways and purpose. Make your enemies a footstool for your feet, that all people in all nations will kiss the Son, so they may know that happy are those who take refuge in you; through Jesus Christ our Lord, forever and ever. Amen</p>
<p><strong>Saturday</strong>: O God, who is the Beginning and the End, hear our prayers as we cry out to you to end the merciless shedding of innocent blood in our nation and throughout the world. Through death you have conquered death, and through your life we experience eternal and everlasting life. Cause life to spring forth in the hearts of all people and bring forth a love and respect for life that will dominate our culture. May your kingdom and church apprehend and overtake the culture of death that has prevailed through deceit and selfishness; may the Seed of the woman crush the head of the serpent through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen
