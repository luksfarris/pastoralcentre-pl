<p>1. This Saturday, the 4th of October, is the Feast of St Francis, a very great feast for our community. On Friday evening after Mass at 6 PM, we will have the memorial service of the death of our beloved founder. This is called the <em>Transitus</em> – the ‘crossing over’ from this world to eternal life. The <em>Transitus</em> commemorates the holy death of St Francis with prayers and readings and songs. We warmly invite you to attend. You can find t<a href="http://www.monkrock.com/index.cfm?load=page&amp;page=379" target="_blank" title="Liturgy of the Transitus in English">he liturgy of the Transitus online</a>.</p>
<p>2. Next Sunday Fr Stanisław will return from his holiday and will celebrate Mass for you. There will also be adoration at the end of Mass next Sunday. I hope that when Fr Stanisław returns, we can meet to discuss ideas and plans for our Pastoral Centre community.</p>
<p>3. Very soon, our organist will introduce some new music for our English Mass. If you would like to learn the new music at home, you can find practice videos online with the notes, music and singing.<br/>
