<p>1. November 1, the <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/b16allsaints.HTM" target="_blank" title="Pope Benedict XVI on All Saints">Feast of All Saints</a>, is a <strong>Holy Day of Obligation</strong>. As usual in Poland, it is also a national holiday from work. Many of you will probably be travelling on the holiday weekend. Please remember that <a href="https://www.ewtn.com/expert/answers/sunday_mass.htm" target="_blank" title="Why do we have to go to Mass on Holy Days of Obligation?">it is our duty as Catholics to observe Holy Days of Obligation by attendance at Mass</a>. Plan ahead and make sure you can get to Mass next Saturday, November 1.</p><p></p>
<p>There will <em>not</em> be an English Mass next Saturday.</p>
<p>2. This week we begin distributing forms for you to write down the names of the dead in your own family. You can return these forms either in person to the sacristy or put them in an envelope and place them in the collection at Mass. The names will be read out on November 23 at our Mass, and Father will offer the Mass for the repose of the souls of all the faithful departed connected with the Pastoral Centre for English-Speakers.</p>
<p>It is customary – but not obligatory – to offer a stipend (monetary donation for the support of the church and the priests) along with your list of departed relatives. If you choose to do this, be sure to enclose your list and donation in an envelope with “English Mass” written on the envelope, and place your envelope in the collection during the English Mass. In this way we will be sure to receive your list. Lists for the English Mass will be on colored paper; if you use the white forms printed in Polish, it is necessary to enclose them in an envelope and clearly mark the envelope, “English Mass.”</p>
<p>Here’s an <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/liturgy/zlitur70.htm" target="_blank">explanation of Mass stipends from EWTN</a>:</p>
<p><em>“[T]he Church considers the Mass as the greatest possible prayer of intercession insofar as it is the perfect offering of Christ to the Father by making present the paschal mystery of his death and resurrection. </em></p>
<p>“Because of the particular role of the priest as mediator between God and man, acting “in persona Christi” when offering the holy sacrifice of the Mass, it is usually considered that special graces may be obtained when he applies the Mass to a particular intention.</p>
<p>“The faithful generally make an offering, called a stipend, to the priest in order to apply the Mass to a specific intention. By making this offering, the faithful, by parting with something that is their own, associate themselves more intimately with Christ who offers himself in the sacred Host, and obtain thereby more abundant fruits (See Pope Paul VI’s letter “Firma in Traditione” of June 13, 1974).</p>
<p>This sacrifice has an infinite value and indeed there is no objective limitation to the number of intentions that can be offered at any Mass.</p>
<p>“The offering of a stipend is also a means whereby Catholic may contribute to the upkeep of the clergy, and the Church in general.”</p>
<p>3. As you remember from last week, our organist is introducing some new music for our English Mass. This week, we will introduce a new musical setting for the “Lamb of God.”  If you would like to learn the new music at home, you can find practice videos online with the notes, music and singing. Follow the links below; we’ll be using the English versions.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ccwatershed.org/video/16565754/?return_url=/icel/" target="_blank">Kyrie (Lord have mercy)</a><br/>
<a href="http://www.ccwatershed.org/video/16567836/?return_url=/icel/" target="_blank">Sanctus (Holy, Holy)</a><br/>
<a href="http://www.ccwatershed.org/video/16567842/?return_url=/icel/" target="_blank">Memorial Acclamation (Mystery of Faith)</a><br/>
<a href="http://www.ccwatershed.org/video/16568276/?return_url=/icel/" target="_blank">Agnus Dei (Lamb of God)</a></p>
<p>4. Please remember the soul of Fr Andrzej’s mother – Balbina Kulczycka – in your prayers. Anyone who wishes to contribute toward the stipend for a Mass to be celebrated for the repose of her soul should go to the sacristy after Mass for more details.
