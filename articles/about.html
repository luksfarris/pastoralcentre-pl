<p><strong></strong>The Pastoral Centre was established in April, 2007 at St. Charles Borromeo Parish in Wrocław by Archbishop Marian Gołębiewski, to meet the pastoral needs of English-speaking foreigners in the diocese. The Conventual Franciscan Friars of St. Charles parish are responsible for the Pastoral Centre.</p>
<p>We are truly an international community. English-speakers who have benefitted from our pastoral care come from France, Germany, England, Ireland, Italy, Spain, the United States, Canada, South Africa, the Philippines, China, Vietnam, India, Korea, Venezuela, Nigeria, Ghana and Russia. Some people are in Wrocław for a weekend; others are here for an extended holiday; some come to work or study for a few months or a few years; and some have settled permanently in Poland. Our priests have served in Poland, the United States, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, England, Italy, the Czech Republic and Russia.</p>
<p>Our experiences, cultures and native languages are diverse, but we are united in our Catholic Faith and in the shared Eucharist at Mass.</p>
<p>The Pastoral Centre welcomes anyone who speaks English and needs the sacraments or pastoral care. If you are a Catholic seeking Mass in English; if you want to have your wedding celebrated in English, or you need to complete missing sacraments (First Communion, Confirmation); if you need confession or a priest’s advice in English; or if you are a non-Catholic English-speaker who is interested in the Catholic Church, we welcome you and invite you to the English Mass at 16:00 every Sunday (18:00 in July and August).</p>
<p>You can also participate in retreats and outings which are offered to help build faith and fellowship among people who attend the English Mass.</p>
<p>If you have special needs, introduce yourself to the priest in the sacristy after Mass, and he will be happy to help you</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you at Mass, and we invite you to the parish café after Mass on Sundays during the academic year.</p>
