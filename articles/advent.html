<h1><span style="color: #ff0000;">The Meaning of Advent</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Contrary to what we might surmise from television and shopping malls, the Christmas season does not begin until <em>Christ’s Mass</em>, the “midnight Mass” on Christmas Eve. This is why, as Catholics, we do not sing Christmas carols, eat Christmas foods or have Christmas parties before Christmas arrives. Christ has not yet come, so there is no Christmas to celebrate! Instead, we are in Advent, a time of waiting, preparation and anticipation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The word “advent” is from the Latin <em>adventus</em>, meaning “an arrival.” In the Church calendar, Advent is the liturgical season that begins the Church year. Advent begins on the Sunday after the Solemnity of Christ the King and continues for four weeks until the vigil of the Christ Mass (commonly referred to as Christmas Eve). It is during this time that the Church gets ready for the “arrival” of the Savior as we prepare to celebrate the Feast of the Nativity. Our preparation includes fasting, prayer, and meditating on God’s precious gift of the Savior.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Although Advent should be a period when we look back in time to the First Advent of the Messiah, born in the little stable in Bethlehem, it is also a time in which to look forward, to the Second Advent of the Christ, when He promised He would return (<a class="verseLink 41_24_30_0_31_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=matthew+24:30-31" target="_blank">Mt 24:30-31</a>; 1 Thes 4:16). It is therefore important for us to get our lives in order, to go humbly to Jesus in the Sacrament of Reconciliation, to purify our souls so we will be able to present ourselves as a pure and holy people to our Lord and Savior. In the solitude of the Advent experience, we make ourselves ready, in humility, to hear both the Archangel’s trumpet and the hymn of the choir of angels so that we can share in the experience of the humble shepherds and be prepared to be awestruck by the miracle of the arrival of the Redeemer-Messiah.</span></p>
