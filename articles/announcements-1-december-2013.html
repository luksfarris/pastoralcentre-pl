<div class="pf-content">1. Because it is the first Sunday of the month, as usual, we will have Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament and Benediction at the end of the Mass.  There will not be a homily this Sunday.<p></p>
<p>2. On behalf of our organist, Krzysztof Sobczuk, I’d like to invite you all to an Advent concert being held in <a href="http://www.wroclaw.karmelicibosi.pl/" target="_blank" title="Announcement on the parish website">St Joseph’s Church in Ołbińska Street</a> on Saturday, December 7 at 7PM.<br/>
The concert will feature organ music, Advent reflections and the Vox Ecclesiae Choir.<br/>
Admission is free and everyone is invited. For directions from where you live, use <a href="http://wroclaw.jakdojade.pl/" target="_blank" title="Jakdojade in Wroclaw">jakdojada</a>.</p>
<p>3. Next Sunday Sunday December eighth, we observe the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary.<br/>
On the chair at the back of the church you will find a <a href="http://www.corazones.org/oraciones/oraciones_maria/novena_inmaculate_conception_kolbe.htm" target="_blank" title="Find the novena online here">Novena to the Blessed Virgin, which was composed by Saint Maximilian Kolbe</a>.<br/>
It’s a beautiful novena, which you can pray at any time.</p>
<p>4. I’d also like to invite you to read <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/first-class-relics-st-maximilian-kolbe/" target="_blank" title="The First-Class Relics of St Maximilian Kolbe">a new text about Saint Maximilian</a> that we’ve just published on our Pastoral Centre website.<br/>
There are many false and silly stories on the Internet about the first-class relics of Saint Maximilian, but the true story has never been told online in English.<br/>
With a lot of help from the archivist at Niepokalanów, the Pastoral Centre has published the true story of St Maximilian’s relics.<br/>
The story includes many photographs that have never been published before.</p>
<p>5. On each Sunday of Advent, we will sing one verse of the chant Rorate caeli as our entrance antiphon.  You can read about the Rorate tradition, see the verses, and hear the entire chant sung <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/rorate-mass/" target="_blank" title="The Rorate Mass">on our website</a>.  You can also find out about <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/oplatki/" target="_blank" title="Opłatki">Opłatek</a> on our website.</p>
