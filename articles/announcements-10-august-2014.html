<p>August 15th, Friday, is the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into Heaven. It is a Holy Day of Obligation for all Catholics. This means that we are obliged to go to Mass on the Solemnity of the Assumption, just as if it were a Sunday.</p>
<p>If you are travelling, be sure to check ahead and make sure that a Catholic church can be found in the area where you will be travelling, and check for Mass times on the Solemnity of the Assumption.</p>
<p>This is a major Marian feast and is celebrated with special liturgies at Marian shrines around Poland, such as the shrine of the Black Madonna at <a href="http://www.jasnagora.pl/en" target="_blank" title="Jasna Góra official page in English">Jasna Góra in Częstochowa</a> and at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalwaria_Pac%C5%82awska" target="_blank" title="Kalwaria Pacławska on Wikipedia">Kalwaria Pacławska</a> in eastern Poland (where <a href="http://nowicjat-kalwaria.franciszkanie.pl/" target="_blank" title="Novitiate, official page in Polish">our Franciscans have their novitiate</a>; if you go to <a href="http://www.kalwariapaclawska.pl/" target="_blank" title="Kalwaria Pacławska, official site in Polish">Kalwaria Pacławska</a> for the Solemnity of the Assumption this year, you might meet our Fr Krzysztof, who will be there hearing confessions for the many thousands of pilgrims to the shrine). If you have no plans yet for the holiday weekend, consider making a pilgrimage to one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrines_to_the_Virgin_Mary#Poland" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia; jump to Poland for a list of shrines">many Marian shrines in Poland</a>.</p>
