<p>1. This Sunday is the nearest Sunday to the anniversary of the election of John Paul II to the papacy on 16 October 1979 – called ‘<a href="http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzie%C5%84_Papie%C5%BCa_Jana_Paw%C5%82a_II" target="_blank" title="Pope's Day on Polish Wikipedia">Pope’s Day</a>‘ in Poland. The Polish Bishops’ Conference has decided that this year, Pope’s Day will be celebrated on October 12th.  The theme of Pope’s Day this year is ‘Be Saints.’ At all the Masses on Sunday, the collection will be for a ‘living memorial’ to St John Paul II, that is, to fund scholarships for students who cannot otherwise afford their studies. Please be generous!</p>
<p>2. As usual, I invite everyone to come to the cafe after Mass.  Last week we started talking about events and activities we might want to plan for the coming year.  I hope you’ll join us.</p>
<p>3. I will be away for a retreat in the coming week, and Fr Andrzej will celebrate Mass for you next Sunday.  If you are in need of an English-speaking priest, please contact the parish office and they will help you as well as they can. You can also contact the <a href="http://www.mati.com.pl/paulini3/?strona,menu,pol,glowna,0,0,1386,ant.html" target="_blank" title="phone number for Fr Michał">Paulist Priest Fr Michał Kurzynka</a>, who recently concelebrated the English Mass with Fr Andrzej and who welcomes English-speakers who may need to talk to a priest or have confession. Fr Andrzej will be away during the week, due to the death of his mother on Sunday.  Please pray for the repose of her soul and for the comfort of Fr Andrzej and his family. </p>
<p>4. As you remember from last week, our organist is introducing some new music for our English Mass (called ‘the ordinaries’ because these prayers are the same at every Mass). If you would like to learn the new music at home, you can find practice videos online with the notes, music and singing.  Follow the links below; we’ll be using the English versions.</p>
