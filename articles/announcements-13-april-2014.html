<p>1. This week is Holy Week. It is the last chance to have confession before Easter. If you still have not had confession, you can try to <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/contact/" title="Contact">make an appointment</a> with an English-speaking priest during the week.</p>
<p>2. I encourage everyone to join us for the Easter Triduum services this week on <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/holy-week-easter-triduum/" target="_blank" title="Holy Week and the Easter Triduum">Holy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday</a>. On Thursday and Friday, the services start at 6PM. On Saturday it is at 9:30PM. Arrive early, since the church fills up quickly.</p>
<p>3. The <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/devotionals/mercy/novena.htm" target="_blank" title="Follow the Divine Mercy Novena online">Divine Mercy Novena</a> begins on Good Friday and ends on Divine Mercy Sunday, April 27th. We have provided booklets with the novena at the entrance of the church.</p>
