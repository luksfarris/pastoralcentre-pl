<p>1. A group from the Pastoral Centre interviewed a local <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/art-anna-szmatula/" target="_blank" title="The Art of Anna Szmatuła">artist and icon-writer named Anna Szmatuła</a>.  Mrs. Szmatuła painted the Stations of the Cross in the Church of Our Lady of Consolation in Wrocław. You can <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/anna-szmatula-cross/" target="_blank" title="Anna Szmatuła: The Way of the Cross">read an interview with the artist</a> and see pictures of her Stations of the Cross on our website.</p>
<p>2. Please remember that we have Stations of the Cross in this parish on Fridays in Lent at 11:15 AM and 5:15 PM.  I encourage you all to join us in prayer and meditation on the suffering and death of Our Lord during the Stations of the Cross.  You can pray using materials in English or your own language, or follow along with the prayers in Polish.</p>
<p>3. I invite you to the parish café after Mass to have something to drink and to meet other people for conversation. If you don’t know how to get to the café, please wait by the doors of the church nearest the chapel, and someone will show you the way.</p>
