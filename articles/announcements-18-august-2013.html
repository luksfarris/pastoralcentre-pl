<p>1. I’d like to invite you to go to our website where you will find an important message about a pro-life initiative in Europe called “<a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/pro-life-initiative/" target="_blank" title="ONE OF US Pro-Life Initiative">One of Us</a>.”  This initiative is in the form of a petition to the European Parliament.  The aim of the petition is to protect human life from the moment of conception.  It opposes such practices as euthanasia, embryonic stem-cell research and human cloning.</p>
<p>The initiative will not be noticed by the Parliament unless one million people sign the petition.  I have already signed this petition, and I urge you to sign the petition and to send information about it to your friends in Europe.</p>
<p>2. Last Sunday, I explained to you about <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/plenary-indulgence-year-faith/" target="_blank" title="Plenary Indulgence in the Year of Faith">a plenary indulgence</a> that you can receive by attending Mass in this parish during the Year of Faith.  I encourage you to look up the information on our website so you can take advantage of this opportunity.
