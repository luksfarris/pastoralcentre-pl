<p>1. October is traditionally a Marian month, specifically, the <a href="http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/overviews/months/10_1.cfm" target="_blank" title="Read more about October, the month of the Rosary">Month of the Holy Rosary</a>. I encourage you to pray the rosary daily in October, especially if this habit is new to you.  You can join us in the parish praying the rosary before the Blessed Sacrament at 17:30 on weekdays, before the Mass at 18:00.  The rosary concludes with benediction of the Blessed Sacrament.</p>
<p>I also invite you to remain after Mass to pray at least a decade of the Rosary today.</p>
<p>2. Everyone is invited to come to the parish cafe after Mass for tea and conversation, especially those who are interested in visiting Fr Krzysztof in Legnica (probably next Saturday).  We need to finalize details for that trip, so please meet in the cafe if you’re interested.  If you don’t know how to get to the cafe, just wait near the doors on the chapel side of the church (right-hand doors when facing the altar) and someone will greet you and show you the way to the cafe.  Remember that when you buy a cup of tea or a piece of cake in the cafe, you are supporting the work of the Catholic charity Caritas.</p>
<p>3. As you remember from last week, our organist is introducing some new music for our English Mass.  This week, we will introduce both a new musical setting for ‘the mystery of faith’ as well as using a different option for this prayer (When we eat this bread…).  If you would like to learn the new music at home, you can find practice videos online with the notes, music and singing.  Follow the links below; we’ll be using the English versions.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ccwatershed.org/video/16565754/?return_url=/icel/" target="_blank">Kyrie (Lord have mercy)</a><br/>
<a href="http://www.ccwatershed.org/video/16567836/?return_url=/icel/" target="_blank">Sanctus (Holy, Holy)</a><br/>

<p>4. Please remember the soul of Fr Andrzej’s mother – Balbina Kulczycka – in your prayers.  Anyone who wishes to contribute toward the stipend for a Mass to be celebrated for the repose of her soul should go to the sacristy after Mass for more details.</p>
<p>5. Next week we will begin distributing forms for you to write down the names of the dead in your own family.  You can return these forms either in person to the sacristy or put them in an envelope and place them in the collection at Mass. The names will be read out on November 23 at our Mass, and Father will offer the Mass for the repose of the souls of all the faithful departed connected with the Pastoral Centre for English-Speakers.</p>
<p>It is customary – but not obligatory – to offer a stipend (monetary donation for the support of the church and the priests) along with your list of departed relatives.  If you choose to do this, be sure to enclose your list and donation in an envelope with ‘English Mass’ written on the envelope, and place your envelope in the collection during the English Mass. In this way we will be sure to receive your list.  Lists for the English Mass will be on colored paper; if you use the white forms printed in Polish, it is necessary to enclose them in an envelope and clearly mark the envelope, ‘English Mass.’</p>
