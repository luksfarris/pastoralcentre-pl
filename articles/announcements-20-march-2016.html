<p>1. If you want confession before Easter, today is your last chance to be sure of finding Fr Lucjan in the confessional. Father will be in the confessional at about 15:30 for confessions before Mass. Remember that he needs to leave the confessional by about 15:55 to vest and pray before Mass.</p>
<p>Fr Lucjan will also be in the confessional after Mass during the 5PM Mass, for those who are too late to have confession before the English Mass.</p>
<p>2. In today’s Palm Sunday liturgy, the congregation will read aloud parts of the Gospel (the role assigned to groups of speakers). You will find the congregation’s words marked in bold print in the Gospel, preceded by <strong>[All]</strong>. The congregation’s lines will also be shown on the screen near the altar. <em>We ask you to sit in the centre rows of pews, close to the front, so the congregation can speak together and be heard by the others who are reading parts of the Gospel</em>.</p>
<p>Please pick up a Bulletin on the way into Mass. You can find them on the chair at the back of the centre aisle and on the table in the chapel entrance to the church.</p>
<p>3. This week, the Church celebrates the Easter Triduum: three days of special liturgies leading up to the holiest of holy days in the Church calendar. If you have never participated in the Triduum liturgies, consider taking the opportunity of attending this year. There are so many churches in Wrocław that you can even go to different churches for each evening’s liturgy. The Triduum is beautiful and profound. You can <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/holy-week-easter-triduum/" target="_blank">read about everything that will happen in each day’s liturgy on our website</a>.</p>
<p>4. Friday – Good Friday – begins the annual Novena of Divine Mercy. To help you pray the Divine Mercy Chaplet and Novena, we have provided small booklets with the prayers. The booklets have a yellow cover; you can find them next to the Bulletins as you come into church today. These booklets are free, though because of limited numbers, we ask that you only take one booklet per adult or per family. You can also find the <a href="https://www.ewtn.com/devotionals/mercy/novena.htm" target="_blank">Novena</a> and <a href="https://www.ewtn.com/devotionals/mercy/dmmap.htm" target="_blank">Chaplet</a> online.</p>
<p>The Novena culminates in <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/feast-divine-mercy/" target="_blank">Divine Mercy Sunday</a>.  A special indulgence of complete remission of the punishment due to sin is granted to all who go to confession, receive Holy Communion and pray for the intentions of the Holy Father on (or within about 10 days of) the <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/feast-divine-mercy/" target="_blank">Feast of Divine Mercy</a>. Please do not miss this wonderful opportunity to accept God’s grace and mercy, especially in this Year of Mercy.
