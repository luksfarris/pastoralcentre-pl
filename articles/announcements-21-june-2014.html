<p>1. Between the Tuesday the 16th and Friday the 26th, the churches of Wrocław will sponsor many concerts, lectures, panel discussions, poetry readings and other cultural events as well as Eucharistic Adoration and Masses in the yearly ‘Nights in the Churches’ event. Music and discussions will feature performers and experts from a variety of countries. There will also be some historic churches and cloisters open for tours on the 19th, 20th and 21st. You can find the <a href="http://swfranciszek-namyslow.pl/images/2015/noce_kosciolow_2015.pdf" target="_blank" title="Churches at Night cultural events">whole schedule of events online</a>, and you can take a paper with the schedule from the tables at the entrances to the church.</p>
<p>2. Today, as part of the ‘Nights in the Churches’ event we will have a visiting priest from Iraq.  He will give the homily at the Mass at 5PM, and at 6PM he will be in the parish cafe.  He speaks English, and will talk about Islamic terrorism.  Everyone is welcome to come.</p>
<p>The cafe is located across the street from the church, behind the priests’ house (the old house with the rooster weathervane on top). To get to the cafe, exit on the chapel side of the church and cross the street at the marked crossing.  On the other side, go left for a few metres and you’ll see a gate with two large concrete balls on top of the pillars on either side of the gate.  Go through the gate straight down to the house and go left, through another gate and around the back of the house. You’ll see a long, three-story addition to the older house.  The entrance to the cafe is at the far left end of the modern addition, past the gazebo and through another gate. Enter the wooden door and go downstairs and to your left into the cafe.</p>
<p>3. July is fast approaching.  Please remember than in July and August, the English Mass is at 6PM.  Our first Mass at 6PM will be on July 5th, the first Sunday of the month.  There will be adoration at the end of Mass as usual on the first Sunday, so if you come by public transport, plan accordingly.
