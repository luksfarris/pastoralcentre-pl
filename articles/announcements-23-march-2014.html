<p>1. This Tuesday, the 25th, is the Solemnity of the Annunciation. Masses in our parish will follow the usual weekday schedule. There will not be an English Mass.</p>
<p>The nine-month period between the Annunciation and Christmas is devoted to praying for unborn children. I strongly encourage you to <a href="http://dayoftheunbornchild.com/9MonthsForLife_PrayerFromMar25-Dec25_SpiritualAdoption_SanctityOfLife_Incarnation.htm" target="_blank" title="How to make the spiritual adoption of an unborn child">make the spiritual adoption of an unborn child</a>. As we know, all around the world, children are threatened by abortion. When you pray for an unborn child, your prayers may save that child from death, and will have a lasting impact on the life of the child.</p>
<p>Your daily prayer can be as simple as a Hail Mary, or you can pray using <a href="http://dayoftheunbornchild.com/9MonthsForLife_PrayerFromMar25-Dec25_SpiritualAdoption_SanctityOfLife_Incarnation.htm" target="_blank" title="Prayers for Spiritual Adoption">prayers especially written for spiritual adoption</a>. You can even follow the Spiritual Adoption movement on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AnnunciationDayMarch25" target="_blank" title="Spiritual Adoption on Facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/March25info" target="_blank" title="Spiritual adoption on Twitter">Twitter</a>. It only takes a few moments every day to pray for a child in the womb as Mary prayed for her child before His birth.</p>
<p>2. Pope Francis has announced a world-wide action to encourage people to return to the sacrament of confession. This event is called ‘<a href="http://www.catholicireland.net/pope-promotes-confession-24-hours-lord/" target="_blank" title="Read about 24 Hours for the Lord in Rome and world-wide">24 Hours for the Lord</a>’. Starting Friday, March 28th at 5PM and continuing for 24 hours, the Cathedral in Wrocław will be open continuously for Eucharistic Adoration and confession. In our parish, exposition of the Blessed Sacrament will begin after the 6PM Mass and continue until 10PM on Friday. During that time, priests will be available for everyone who wishes to go to confession.</p>
<p>To help you prepare for confession, we have provided a ‘Guide to Confession’ which you will find on the chair at the back of the church and on the table near the chapel.</p>
<p>3. On Saturday, April 12, the Pastoral Centre will offer a one-day retreat at the <a href="http://www.ndwroclaw.com/" target="_blank" title="Website of the Sisters of Notre Dame, directions, pictures">convent of the Sisters of Notre Dame</a>, very close to the Cathedral here in Wrocław. The retreat will begin at 9:30 AM and end at 7 PM. The cost of the retreat is 50 zloties, not including food.  Meals can be arranged with the sisters (we tell them we want to eat in, and they order our meal from a catering service and we pay for it) or participants can bring their own food from home (it will be possible to heat food in a kitchen). If you are bringing your own food, assume you will be present for ‘dinner’ (the big meal in the middle of the day) and a light collation in the late afternoon.</p>
<p>If you want to participate, please let me know by next Sunday.</p>
<p>4. During Lent, the parish is collecting food and cleaning products to be distributed to the needy at Easter. Large baskets will be available in the church, where you can deposit basic food items (oil, sugar, flour, canned goods, baby formula, pasta, rice,  and other dry goods – no perishable items or items that are damaged or past their ‘best-before’ date, please) and things like soap and washing powder or household cleaning supplies.  If you are not sure what to bring, look into the baskets for ideas, or when you are shopping simply buy a two items that your family would use instead of one, and donate the second to the collection.</p>
<p>This collection will continue throughout Lent, so please remember the poor of the parish when you are doing your weekly shopping, and bring your donations when you come to Mass.</p>
<p>5. As usual, the parish café is open to everyone after Mass. If you don’t know where the café is, wait outside near the doors of the chapel, and someone will show you the way. It is always pleasant to meet people who are new to the English Mass. If you come to the café today, I can also answer your questions about the retreat on April 12th.</p>
