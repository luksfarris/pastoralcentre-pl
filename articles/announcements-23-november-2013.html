<p>2. Next Sunday is the first Sunday in Advent and also the beginning of a new liturgical year in the Church. There will be adoration of the Blessed Sacrament at the end of Mass next Sunday.</p>
<p>3. On Sunday December eighth, we observe the <a href="http://catholicism.about.com/od/holydaysandholidays/p/Imm_Conception.htm" target="_blank" title="Read about the Solemnity">Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary</a>. This means that on November 29th we will begin praying a novena in preparation for the Solemnity. At daily Mass at 7AM, noon and 6PM, in our parish the homily will be devoted to the Immaculate Conception, and there will be special novena prayers at the end of Mass. I invite everyone to come to these Masses, or you can <a href="http://www.corazones.org/oraciones/oraciones_maria/novena_inmaculate_conception_kolbe.htm" target="_blank" title="Novena by St Maximilian Kolbe">pray a novena privately</a> from the 29th of November until the 8th of December.
