<p>1. On Sunday, November 1, the Feast of All Saints, our English Mass will be offered for the repose of the souls of people close to members of the congregation of the Pastoral Centre.</p>
<p>Yellow sheets were provided before Mass in the past two weeks for listing the names of your departed family, friends and benefactors.  Everyone was asked to place these lists in the collection at Mass.</p>
<p>If you have not yet returned your list of names, you can turn it in to the sacristy before Mass on November 1.  It is important to return the list <em>before</em> Mass begins.  The names on the lists will be read out at the start of Mass, so please don’t wait until the last moment to turn in your list.</p>
<p>2. If you are unable to turn in a list, you can still pray for the souls of your dead at the Mass by remembering their names in your heart and prayers before Mass and during the Eucharistic Prayer when the priest prays for the faithful departed.</p>
<p>3. November is the traditional month for praying for the dead in Poland. If you would like your dead to be remembered at Masses in Polish, you can fill in a white sheet labelled ‘Wypominki’ (different forms are found in every parish) and put it in the collection at Mass in that church.  If you do this, remember to PRINT the names very clearly, especially non-Polish names, which may be difficult for the priest to read out or pronounce. </p>
<p>Many parishes read the names according to the streets in the parish, and will ask parishioners to write the name of their street on the Wypominki sheet. They publish the names of the streets that will be covered at different Masses in their announcements online or on a printed notice at the church.  Follow the directions on the ‘Wypominki’ form in your own parish if you plan to use those lists.
