<p>2. As you know, Thursday May first and Saturday May third are legal holidays. In Poland May third is also celebrated as the Solemnity of Mary, Queen of Poland. It is not a holy day of obligation, and there will not be an English Mass on May third.</p>
<p>However, since May is a traditional Marian month, I encourage you to celebrate the solemnity of Mary, Queen of Poland, by attending Mass in Polish on May third. Masses in this parish will be on the <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/parish/masses/" target="_blank" title="Masses">same schedule as Sunday</a>.</p>
<p>3. Also, during the month of May, it is traditional to pray the <a href="http://www.ewtn.com/faith/teachings/maryd6f.htm" target="_blank" title="Litany of Loreto">Litany of Loreto</a> every day.  The Litany will be prayed on weekdays after the noon Mass and at 17:30, one-half hour before the 6PM Mass.  On Sundays, the Litany will be prayed at 6PM.   I invite you to join us for the litany, or to pray the litany of Loreto at home.</p>
<p>4. As usual, we will meet in the café after Mass for tea and conversation. If you don’t know how to get to the café, just wait by the side doors and someone will show you the way.</p>
