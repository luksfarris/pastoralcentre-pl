<p>2. In summer, our priests take holidays and there are fewer priests available in the parish than there are during the academic year.  This applies to our English-speaking priests as well.  In practical terms, it means that there might be some days in the week when there are no English-speaking priests present in the parish. Sunday Mass will always be offered, but often there will only be one English-speaking priest available on Sunday.  This means that if you want confession during July and August, you should arrive at Mass 20-30 minutes early and remember that the priest needs to leave the confessional 5 minutes before Mass begins: most of the time it will <strong>not</strong> be possible to have one priest at the altar and another in the confessional during the English Mass.  If you need confession or to speak to a priest during the week, contact the priests directly, but be aware that there may be a wait until a priest is available who speaks English.</p>
