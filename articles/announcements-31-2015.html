<p>1. On Saturday, 30 May, the Franciscan province celebrated the ordination of its new Franciscan priests. Two of these priests – Fr Adam Mikosiak  and Fr Marcin Jelinek – are from St Charles Borromeo parish in Wrocław, and they will celebrate their first Masses as priests in our church today, Sunday.</p>
<p>It is customary for priests to be ordained at this time of year – late May and early June.  This means that most of our priests are celebrating the anniversary of their ordinations, so it is appropriate that today’s Mass will be offered in thanksgiving for the priestly vocations of our Franciscan priests, especially those who have served us in the Pastoral Centre for English-Speakers: Fr Piotr Tymko (2007-2008; 21 years a priest); Fr Dariusz Sowa (2008-2010; ordained 2007) and Fr Stanisław Stec (2009-2012); Fr Daniel Zdebik (2010-2012; ordained 2007); Fr Krzysztof Kukułka (2012-2014; celebrating 30 years of priestly service this year); and Fr Andrzej Kulczycki (2011-present) and Fr Stanisław Rochowiak, our current Rector (ordained 20 years ago). </p>
<p>Let us remember to pray daily for our priests, that God will strengthen them to fulfill their vows as Franciscan brothers and as priests, and that all their works may be for the glory of God, the salvation of souls and the good of the Franciscan Order.</p>
<p>2. This Thursday, June 4th, is the Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ (Corpus Christi).  It is a Holy Day of Obligation in Poland, as well as a national holiday.  </p>
<p>A Holy Day of Obligation means that all Catholics are bound to attend Mass on Corpus Christi this Thursday. (If you do not go to Mass on a Holy Day of Obligation, it is like missing Sunday Mass: you need to confess this failure in the Sacrament of Reconciliation before approaching Holy Communion again.)</p>
<p>There will <em><strong>not</strong></em> be an English Mass on Thursday, June 4th in St Charles parish.  At 4PM there will be a Polish Mass, followed by the traditional Eucharistic Procession through the streets around the church.  The procession will take place at about 5PM, meaning that there will be no 5PM Mass in St Charles Church on Corpus Christi.</p>
<p>If you plan to travel during the Corpus Christi holiday, please remember God and the great gift of being able to receive His Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity in Holy Communion. Look online for Catholic churches in the place you are travelling to, find out the Mass times, and include Mass attendance (include God) in your holiday plans.</p>
