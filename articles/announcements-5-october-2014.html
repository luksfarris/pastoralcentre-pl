<p>1. The parish cafe is open now, so I invite you to the cafe for tea and conversation.  I hope I will be able to meet with you today and talk about plans for future events in the Pastoral Centre.  The cafe is located behind the priest’s house (with the rooster on the roof) across Krucza street from the church.  Go out the chapel side of the church, cross the street and enter the grounds of the house with the rooster on the roof. There are two gates: one for cars and one for pedestrians. Enter by the pedestrian gate, and when you reach the house, go left around the back of the house.  The entrance to the parish centre is all the way at the end of the modern wing at the back of the house. When you get to the door at the far end of the building, enter, go downstairs and turn left – that’s the entrance to the cafe. You can see the cafe on the left through the windows as you approach the doors at the end of the new wing.</p>
<p>If you don’t know how to get to the cafe, just wait outside the chapel and someone will greet you and show you the way.</p>
<p>2. Starting today with the Kyrie, our organist will introduce some new music for our English Mass. If you would like to learn the new music at home, you can find practice videos online with the notes, music and singing.  Follow the links below; we’ll be using the English versions.</p>
