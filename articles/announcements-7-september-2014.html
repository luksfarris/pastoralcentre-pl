<p>1. The parish cafe is open again after the summer holiday. Everyone is invited to go to the parish cafe for conversation, especially about plans to go on trips or pilgrimages or to meet together apart from the Mass. It would be great to take advantage of the beautiful September weather and go on a trip.  Let us know what you think!  Come to the cafe after Mass.</p>
<p>If you don’t know how to get to the cafe, just wait outside the church on the chapel side (south doors) and someone will show you the way.</p>
<p>2. Please remember that you can take home the liturgical bulletin <em>The Lord’s Day</em>. However, if you don’t want to take home your copy, please leave it either on the table at the south entrance of the church, or on the chair at the main entrance, or on the pew nearest the doors at the north entrance of the church. </p>
<p>Each bulletin is normally used for two Sundays.  On the first Sunday, extra bulletins are collected to put them out for the second Sunday.  When you return them to the entrance of the church, it helps us to collect them all.  On the second Sunday, the bulletins are left on a table at the entrance of the church for parishioners to pick up and take away during the week.  Please don’t leave the bulletins in the pews; it just means someone has to go through the church ‘cleaning them up.’ </p>
<p>3. You can read the homilies from the English Mass on our website.  We do our best to post them Sunday evening, so if you don’t see them immediately when you get home from Mass, check later in the evening or on Monday.</p>
<p>4. Fr Stanisław is on holiday for the month of September.  Fr Andrzej will celebrate the English Mass every Sunday this month.  It also means that we have only one English-speaking priest in the parish. If you want to have confession in English, you should either make an appointment with Fr Andrzej (go to the sacristy after Mass or talk to him in the cafe) or arrive at Mass early and ask in the sacristy if Fr Andrzej can be called to the church early.  Father would normally have to leave the confessional about 10 minutes before Mass, so take that into consideration if you want confession before the English Mass.  Confession after the English Mass is usually easy to arrange during the Polish-language Mass that follows ours.  Again, ask Fr Andrzej in the sacristy after Mass if you want confession after Mass.</p>
<p><em>Fr Andrzej</em>
