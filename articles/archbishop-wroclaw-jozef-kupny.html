<p>Archbishop Józef Kupny was born on 23 February 1956 in Dąbrówka Wielka. He entered the seminary in Kraków in 1975, but his studies were very soon interrupted by compulsory military service, which lasted for two years. He was ordained priest on 31 March 1983 in Katowice and served as priest in parishes in the Katowice Diocese. In 1993 he received his doctorate degree in sociology from the Catholic University of Lublin, and in 1998 he became an assistant professor in the Department of Catholic Social doctrine at the Catholic University of Lublin.</p>

<p>From 2001-2006 Fr Józef Kupny was rector of the seminary in Katowice as well as serving as the Deputy Director of the General Department of Pastoral Care in the Metropolitan Curia in Katowice. In December 2005, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Fr Józef to be an auxiliary bishop in the Archdiocese of Katowice, and in the following year, Katowice Archbishop Damian Zimoń appointed Bishop Kupny to be Vicar General of the Archdiocese.</p>
<p>On 18 May 2013, Pope Francis appointed Bishop Józef to be the Archbishop of the Wrocław Diocese, taking over for Archbishop Marian Gołębiewski, who has reached retirement age (75 years). Archbishop Marian has been a bishop for seventeen years, first in Koszalin-Kolobrzeg from 1996, then since April 2004 as the Archbishop of Wrocław. Last year Archbishop Marian celebrated the 50th anniversary of his priestly ordination. He is looking forward to retirement and more time for reading and travel.</p>
<p>Archbishop Józef’s ingress into the Cathedral of St John the Baptist will be at 15:00 on 16 June 2013. The Archbishop’s episcopal motto is “<em>Chrystus nas umiłował</em>” — “Christ loved us.”</p>
<p>Let us remember our new Archbishop, Józef Kupny, in our prayers:</p>
