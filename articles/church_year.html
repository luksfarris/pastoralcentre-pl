<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Church year, or liturgical year, begins with Advent, when we anticipate and await the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ at His nativity. Most of us have been experiencing this season of the Church since we were children. Perhaps it is so familiar as to be unremarkable. We take it for granted.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">But for billions of people around the world for the past 2,000 years, what we await in Advent is not only remarkable, it’s preposterous. It’s <em>incredible</em> in the pure sense of that word: <em>it is not to be believed.</em> How could the almighty, omnipotent God become a mere <em></em>man? God is God. Man is man. And Christians are crazy for confusing the two.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">To us, of course, the answer seems obvious: the almighty, omnipotent God <em>could</em> become man precisely because He <em>is</em> almighty and omnipotent; and He <em>would</em> become man because He loves us so much. It may be so obvious that we never give it another thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Incarnation of Christ is worthy of a lifetime of thought. But as we begin the Church Year and as an introduction to this section of our website, perhaps we can focus on just one aspect of what the Incarnation of God means to us Christians. It means that Christians never reject God’s creation. We know that God created the world and pronounced it “good.” Then He created man, the crown of His creation, and pronounced it all “very good” (cf. Gn 1). And then man dwelt in longing and hope for the greatest good of all: when the Messiah would appear, the Incarnate God, Emmanuel – God-with-us. Christianity, then is a uniquely “incarnational” religion. And as such, it is a religion that celebrates the goodness of creation.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We can see the incarnational nature of Christianity in our sacraments. Man is body and spirit. Hence the sacraments are not purely spiritual, but involve our bodies and other matter: bread, wine, oil, water. Our liturgies too are feasts for the senses: bells, incense, candles, colors. We bring our bodies and not just our minds and hearts to Mass on Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It should come as no surprise, then, that if we wish to go more deeply into our lives as Christians by living the liturgical year, we will find practices that fully involve our senses. As we live out and celebrate our faith through the liturgical year, we will encounter many delightful things to see and touch, smell, taste and hear, as well as penitential practices that help us keep virtuous control of our bodies. We will bring our bodies, minds and spirits into fuller participation with the life of the Church, both in the liturgy and in our homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In these pages, you will find general information about the liturgical year, to help you become more familiar with the seasons of the Church. You will also find information about particularly Polish ways of celebrating holy days and observing days of penance, as well as Polish customs related to different feasts, so that if you are new to Poland you can better understand and participate in the life of the Church throughout the liturgical year.</span></p>
