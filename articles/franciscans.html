<p>The pastoral ministry of St. Charles Borromeo Parish was confided to the care of Franciscan priests at the end of World War II. The Franciscans are one of the most well-known and beloved of the Catholic religious orders.<br/>

The Franciscans began with just one man, St. Francis of Assisi. Francis was born in 1182, in Umbria, in Italy. Francis grew up in a prosperous household and enjoyed the luxuries and pleasures of his class. But by the time he was about 25 years old, he had reached a turning-point in his life: more and more he longed for something higher and better than a life of comfort and amusement. He began to devote himself to the sick and poor, particularly to lepers. One day he went into the ruined church of San Damiano and heard an inward voice urging him to rebuild it. He immediately began the task, begging for materials and doing the work with his own hands, while living on whatever food charitable people offered him.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In 1209, Francis was struck by a homily he heard concerning Jesus’s instructions when He sent out His disciples to preach the Gospel: ‘“Do not get any gold or silver or copper to take with you in your belts; no bag for the journey or extra shirt or sandals or a staff, for the worker is worth his keep”’ (<a class="verseLink 41_10_9_0_0_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=matthew+10:9" target="_blank">Mt 10:9</a>). This prescription of radical poverty became one of the hallmarks of Franciscan spirituality and the Franciscan way of life. Francis’s poverty and simplicity of life, his love of God and his fellow man, his profound joy in God his Savior proved powerfully attractive, and within a couple of years of following his new way of life, he had twelve companions dedicated to the same life, men he called “<em>fraticelli</em>,” or “little brothers.” Within eleven years, there were more than five thousand brothers, or “friars” living in the spirit of St Francis. The Franciscans have continued to grow in numbers and to spread the Gospel around the world for 800 years.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">When most people think of Franciscans, they imagine men in brown habits. This is an overly simplistic view, probably made popular by so many images of St Francis in which he is shown wearing a simple brown tunic with a white cord. However, when thinking about the Franciscans, one might do well to bear in mind an image Christ gave of the Kingdom of God: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in his field.  It is the smallest of all the seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree, so that birds of the air come and make nests in its branches” (<a class="verseLink 41_13_31_0_0_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=matthew+13:31" target="_blank">Mt. 13:31</a>). The Franciscans have developed similarly,  from one man – <em>il poverello</em>, the little, poor man Francis – to a large and diverse extended family of men and women who over eight centuries have been inspired to follow his example.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">There are in fact three Franciscan Orders.  The first order is the Friars Minor, which comprises three branches all originating from the same stem.  They are called the Friars Minor, the Friars Minor Capuchins (both have brown habits) and the Friars Minor Conventual (black habits).  All of these profess the same rule of the Friars Minor that was approved by Pope Honorious III in 1223, but each has its own peculiar constitutions and its own minister general.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Second Order in the Franciscan family tree are the “poor ladies,” now commonly called the Poor Clares.  These are cloistered nuns who profess the rule of St Clare, which was approved by Pope Innocent IV in 1253.  St Clare, of course, was an early follower of St Francis and the first woman to dedicate herself wholly to the Franciscan way of life. In many ways her life story and spiritual journey parallels that of Francis, and theirs was one of the great spiritual friendships of Christian history.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Finally there is the Third Order of St Francis (also known as Franciscan tertiaries).  The Third Order Secular was founded by St Francis in about 1221 and is comprised of devout persons of both sexes who live in the world and follow a rule of life which was first approved by Pope Nicholas IV in 1289.  The Third Order Regular refers to Franciscan men who profess vows and express their Franciscan spirit in a variety of ministries within the Church.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Our own Franciscans in St Charles Borromeo Parish are of the Order of Friars Minor Conventual (in England, they are called ‘Greyfriars’ because of the color of their habits). This branch of the Franciscans can be traced back to the earliest days of the Franciscan Order, when the friars questioned how best to live according to the spirit of their founder. Some preferred the quiet and contemplation of rural life, while others were content to settle in cities, ministering to the growing urban population, preaching and teaching in academic institutions. These “urban” Franciscans lived in convents and eventually came to be called “Conventuals.” Currently, there are about 290 Conventual Franciscan houses around the world, with about 5,000 friars. Although they are located in Italy, the United States, Canada, Australia, South and Central America and Africa, the largest number of Conventual Franciscans are in Poland, drawn perhaps by the work and inspiration of St. Maximilian Kolbe (whose statue can be seen in our parish church, along with those of St. Anthony of Padua and St. Francis).</span></p>
