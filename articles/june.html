<p class="wp-caption-text">Pope Urban IV</p>
</div>
<p>In 1264, Pope Urban IV decreed that the Solemnity of Corpus Christi would be celebrated in the universal church on the Thursday after Pentecost.  The Holy Father asked <a href="http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=2530" target="_blank" title="Thomas Aquinas biography">Saint Thomas Aquinas</a> to compose a sequence for the Mass and hymns for the Divine Office for the day.  <em>Lauda Sion</em> is the sequence for the Mass of the Feast of Corpus Christi.  The last four verses are often sung as a separate hymn.  The verses are a rich meditation and instruction on our belief in the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIRpMWQ9yIQ" target="_blank" title="Lauda Sion on YouTube">listen to the Latin chant</a> to hear what the hymn sounds like in its original form, or read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauda_Sion" target="_blank" title="Lauda Sion, Latin and English">Latin and English verses side-by-side</a>.</p>
<p>Sion, lift up thy voice and sing:<br/>
Praise thy Savior and thy King,<br/>
Praise with hymns thy shepherd true.</p>
<p>All thou canst, do thou endeavour:<br/>
Yet thy praise can equal never<br/>
Such as merits thy great King.</p>
<p>See today before us laid<br/>
The living and life-giving Bread,<br/>
Theme for praise and joy profound.</p>
<p>The same which at the sacred board<br/>
Was, by our incarnate Lord,<br/>
Giv’n to His Apostles round.</p>
<p>Let the praise be loud and high:<br/>
Sweet and tranquil be the joy<br/>
Felt today in every breast.</p>
<p>On this festival divine<br/>
Which records the origin<br/>
Of the glorious Eucharist.</p>
<p>On this table of the King,<br/>
Our new Paschal offering<br/>
Brings to end the olden rite.</p>
<p>Here, for empty shadows fled,<br/>
Is reality instead,<br/>
Here, instead of darkness, light.</p>
<p>His own act, at supper seated<br/>
Christ ordain’d to be repeated<br/>
In His memory divine;</p>
<p>Wherefore now, with adoration,<br/>
We, the host of our salvation,<br/>
Consecrate from bread and wine.</p>
<p>Hear, what holy Church maintaineth,<br/>
That the bread its substance changeth<br/>
Into Flesh, the wine to Blood.</p>
<p>Doth it pass thy comprehending?<br/>
Faith, the law of sight transcending<br/>
Leaps to things not understood.</p>
<p>Here beneath these signs are hidden<br/>
Priceless things, to sense forbidden,<br/>
Signs, not things, are all we see.</p>
<p>Flesh from bread, and Blood from wine,<br/>
Yet is Christ in either sign,<br/>
All entire, confessed to be.</p>
<p>They, who of Him here partake,<br/>
Sever not, nor rend, nor break:<br/>
But, entire, their Lord receive.</p>
<p>Whether one or thousands eat:<br/>
All receive the self-same meat:<br/>
Nor the less for others leave.</p>
<p>Both the wicked and the good<br/>
Eat of this celestial Food:<br/>
But with ends how opposite!</p>
<p>Here ’tis life: and there ’tis death:<br/>
The same, yet issuing to each<br/>
In a difference infinite.</p>
<p>Nor a single doubt retain,<br/>
When they break the Host in twain,<br/>
But that in each part remains<br/>
What was in the whole before.</p>
<p>Since the simple sign alone<br/>
Suffers change in state or form:<br/>
The signified remaining one<br/>
And the same for evermore.</p>
<p>Lo! bread of the Angels broken,<br/>
For us pilgrims food, and token<br/>
Of the promise by Christ spoken,<br/>
Children’s meat, to dogs denied.</p>
<p>Shewn in Isaac’s dedication,<br/>
In the manna’s preparation:<br/>
In the Paschal immolation,<br/>
In old types pre-signified.</p>
<p>Jesu, shepherd of the sheep:<br/>
Thou thy flock in safety keep,<br/>
Living bread, thy life supply:<br/>
Strengthen us, or else we die,<br/>
Fill us with celestial grace.</p>
<p>Thou, who feedest us below:<br/>
Source of all we have or know:<br/>
Grant that with Thy Saints above,<br/>
Sitting at the feast of love,<br/>
We may see Thee face to face.</p>
<p>Amen. Alleluia.</p>

<p><em>Pange Lingua Gloriosi</em> is another hymn written by Aquinas for the Solemnity of Corpus Christi.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZtnnHyOqSg" target="_blank" title="Pange Lingua">The tune of this hymn</a> is more familiar to contemporary Catholics because we sing the last two verses (referred to by the first two words in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pange_Lingua_Gloriosi_Corporis_Mysterium" target="_blank" title="Pange Lingua, Latin and English">the Latin text</a> – <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEXkwjKp2C4" target="_blank" title="Tantum ergo"><em>Tantum ergo</em></a>) at Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament.  The hymn is also sung on Holy Thursday during the procession when the Blessed Sacrament is removed from the tabernacle and taken to a place of reposition outside the church or away from the sanctuary.</p>
<p>Sing, my tongue, the Saviour’s glory,<br/>
of His Flesh, the mystery sing;<br/>
of the Blood, all price exceeding,<br/>
shed by our Immortal King,<br/>
destined, for the world’s redemption,<br/>
from a noble Womb to spring.</p>
<p>Of a pure and spotless Virgin<br/>
born for us on earth below,<br/>
He, as Man, with man conversing,<br/>
stayed, the seeds of truth to sow;<br/>
then He closed in solemn order<br/>
wond’rously His Life of woe.</p>
<p>On the night of that Last Supper,<a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Last-Supper-Joan-de-Joanes-1510-1579-smaller.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1814" height="189" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" src="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Last-Supper-Joan-de-Joanes-1510-1579-smaller-300x189.jpg" srcset="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Last-Supper-Joan-de-Joanes-1510-1579-smaller-300x189.jpg 300w, http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Last-Supper-Joan-de-Joanes-1510-1579-smaller.jpg 314w" title="Last Supper Joan de Joanes 1510-1579 smaller" width="300"/></a><br/>
seated with His chosen band,<br/>
He, the Paschal Victim eating,<br/>
first fulfils the Law’s command;<br/>
then as Food to His Apostles<br/>
gives Himself with His own Hand.</p>
<p>Word-made-Flesh, the bread of nature<br/>
by His Word to Flesh He turns;<br/>
wine into His Blood He changes;<br/>
what though sense no change discerns?</p>
<p>Only be the heart in earnest,<br/>
faith her lesson quickly learns.</p>
<p>Down in adoration falling,</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">Corpus Christi Procession</p>
</div>
<p>This great Sacrament we hail,<br/>
O’er ancient forms of worship<br/>
Newer rites of grace prevail;<br/>
Faith will tell us Christ is present,<br/>
When our human senses fail.</p>
<p>To the Everlasting Father,<br/>
And the Son who made us free<br/>
And the Spirit, God proceeding<br/>
From them Each eternally,<br/>
Be salvation, honour, blessing,<br/>
Might and endless majesty.</p>
<p>Amen. Alleluia.</p>
<p><em>Sacris Solemniis</em> (is another of the five hymns St Thomas composed for the Feast of the Body and Blood of Christ.  It is probably most famous to modern ears for the strophe, the last two stanzas beginning <em>Panis angelicus</em> (Bread of angels), which has been <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK3TeWqSAZk" target="_blank" title="Panis angelicus, Cesar Franck">set to music</a> by various composers to a hymn on their own.  Sacris Solemniis is a lovely affirmation of simple faith in the Eucharistic Presence:</p>
<p>At this our solemn feast<br/>
let holy joys abound,<br/>
and from the inmost breast<br/>
let songs of praise resound;<br/>
let ancient rites depart,<br/>
and all be new around,<br/>
in every act, and voice, and heart.</p>
<p>Remember we that eve,<br/>
when, the Last Supper spread,<br/>
Christ, as we all believe,<br/>
the Lamb, with leavenless bread,<br/>
among His brethren shared,<br/>
and thus the Law obeyed,<br/>
of all unto their sire declared.</p>
<p>The typic Lamb consumed,<br/>
the legal Feast complete,<br/>
the Lord unto the Twelve<br/>
His Body gave to eat;<br/>
the whole to all, no less<br/>
the whole to each did mete<br/>
with His own hands, as we confess.</p>
<p>He gave them, weak and frail,<br/>
His Flesh, their Food to be;<br/>
on them, downcast and sad,<br/>
His Blood bestowed He:<br/>
and thus to them He spake,<br/>
“Receive this Cup from Me,<br/>
and all of you of this partake.”</p>
<p>So He this Sacrifice<br/>
to institute did will,<br/>
and charged His priests alone<br/>
that office to fulfill:<br/>
to them He did confide:<br/>
to whom it pertains still<br/>
to take, and the rest divide.</p>
<p>Thus Angels’ Bread is made<br/>
the Bread of man today:<br/>
the Living Bread from heaven<br/>
with figures dost away:<br/>
O wondrous gift indeed!<br/>
the poor and lowly may<br/>
upon their Lord and Master feed.</p>
<p>Thee, therefore, we implore,<br/>
O Godhead, One in Three,<br/>
so may Thou visit us<br/>
as we now worship Thee;<br/>
and lead us on Thy way,<br/>
That we at last may see<br/>
the light wherein Thou dwellest aye.</p>
<p>The last two verses in Latin are sometimes sung in our English Mass:</p>
<p>Panis angelicus<br/>
fit panis hominum;<br/>
dat panis caelicus<br/>
figuris terminum;<br/>
O res mirabilis:<br/>
manducat Dominum<br/>
pauper, servus et humilis.</p>
<p>Te, trina Deitas<br/>
unaque, poscimus:<br/>
sic nos tu visita,<br/>
sicut te colimus;<br/>
per tuas semitas<br/>
duc nos quo tendimus,<br/>
ad lucem quam inhabitas.</p>
