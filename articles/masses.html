<h1>MASS INTENTIONS</h1>
<p>You can ask to have a Mass said for a special intention in the sacristy or in the Parish Office.  Mass intentions are normally written in Polish for Polish Masses, and in Polish or English for English Masses.  If you want a Mass intention for the English Mass and you do not speak Polish, ask the English-speaking priest before or after the English Mass.</p>
<p>Be aware that St. Charles Borromeo is a large and busy parish, so the intentions book fills up quickly, and you may not be able to request a Mass for a particular date if you wait until very close to that date.  Often people go to the sacristy early in the year and reserve Masses for their special dates through the entire year, rather than waiting until a week or a few days before a special date.  However, the intention for the English Mass is usually the last to be filled, so there’s often a chance of reserving the intention for the English Mass even a week ahead of time.</p>
<p>It is customary – but not mandatory – to offer a stipend (monetary donation) when asking for a Mass to be said. Stipends are used for the material needs of the priests and for the good of the Church. The stipend is completely voluntary, and not required.  Like all donations to the Church, the amount offered is at the private discretion of the parishioner who wishes to ask for a Mass to be celebrated for a particular intention; if someone cannot afford a stipend, he or she will not be turned away.  If you are unsure what to offer, notice the various amounts listed in the registry book, and offer what you feel comfortable with.</p>
