<p>On Friday and Saturday, September 21 and 22, 2012, Father Krzystof led four of us from the Pastoral Centre on a retreat to Sobótka, a small town on the northern slope of Mount Ślęża (also called Mount Sobótka) about 35km from Wrocław.</p>

<p>People have been going up the mountain since at least the Bronze Age (700 BC), when Ślęża was a centre of pagan worship. Archaeologists have unearthed several monolithic sculptures from the period before Christians arrived in the region and established a monastery there in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>On the way to our destination, we stopped at a small castle called Zamek Górka, which dates from the 1200s. Now it’s a partially restored and serves as a hotel. The proprietor gave us an impromptu tour of the <a href="http://www.polskiturysta.pl/?art=gal&amp;id=127&amp;f=Frontp.jpg&amp;d=0" target="_blank">dining and sitting rooms</a>. They were decorated with ornate furniture, tiled stoves and many hunters’ trophies of antlers and skulls.</p>
<p>We stayed in a nearby pilgrimage house, where we were welcomed by our hosts, two of the Sisters of Saint Elizabeth. We enjoyed walking in their small, well-kept flower garden and eating their greenhouse tomatoes and homemade applesauce with our delicious meals.</p>
<p>On the night we arrived, the men of the group built a campfire in the garden. We had a nice long conversation, sometimes touching on the theme of our scheduled talk for the next day, but mostly telling stories and getting to know each other better.</p>

<p>As on our previous retreat, during the night we could go downstairs from our rooms to a small chapel for private prayer before the Blessed Sacrament. The next morning our group celebrated Mass together in the chapel. After Mass and breakfast, Father Krzysztof led us in a discussion about the mystery of evil. We took turns reading relevant <em>Catechism</em> passages that Father had prepared, and we all shared our insights and questions.</p>
<p>In the late morning, one of the sisters kindly drove us to the far side of the mountain, so that we could go up the mountain on the gentler approach to the top, and descend on the steep side. The weather was warm and sunny as we hiked to the top and took in the view from the lookout point.</p>

<p>After coffee and hot chocolate at a café, we made our descent, staying ahead of the rain clouds that had started to gather, and returning to the convent for our mid-day meal before taking our leave of the sisters in the late afternoon.</p>
<p>We returned to Wroclaw Saturday evening, pleasantly tired from the exercise, but spiritually refreshed for the coming week.</p>
