<p class="wp-caption-text">Church of Saint Charles Borromeo Wroclaw, 2010</p>
</div>
<p>St Charles Borromeo Parish had its beginnings in a convent chapel, nearly fifty years before the Second World War, when this region of Poland was Germany, and Wrocław was known as Breslau. In 1892, a convent of the Sisters of Mercy of St Charles Borromeo recognized the need of a place for Catholics to gather for the Holy Mass in the neighborhood of what is now Krucza Street. So they built a chapel under the patronage of St Charles Borromeo for this purpose.</p>
<p>The neighbourhood grew rapidly, and it was clear that the many Catholics in the area would need their own church. In 1911, the cornerstone was laid for <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/st-charles-borromeo-church-pictures/" target="_blank" title="St Charles Borromeo Church in Pictures">the parish church of St Charles Borromeo</a>. The church was consecrated in 1913. In the siege of Breslau in 1945, the church was bombed and heavily damaged. At the end of the War, it seemed as though the church was beyond repair and would be pulled down. However, in 1947 the first Franciscans arrived in Wrocław to take over the devastated church and rebuild it. Their efforts spanned many years, and the restoration and rebuilding of the church was truly a labor of love and devotion, shared between the parishioners and the Franciscans. (You can read more about the rebuilding of the church in the history of the Franciscans in Wrocław, <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/franciscans/history/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>A parish, of course, is more than its buildings. A parish is a community of the faithful, united in love and devotion to God.  St Charles Borromeo parish is a large and thriving parish. Within the parish there is a shrine devoted to Our Lady of Grace and Protectress of Marriages and Families. There are faith-based groups reflecting a wide variety of interests, from the Rosary Circle to Catholic Action; an award-winning choir and the Militia Immaculata; Girl Scouts and Secular Franciscans, to name a few. And of course, there is our own Pastoral Centre for English-Speakers.</p>
<p>The parish has a rich liturgical life reflecting the depth and beauty of the Catholic tradition as well as the particular devotions of Polish Catholicism. Many devotions that have faded into obscurity or been forgotten in English-speaking countries are practiced here with enthusiasm and reverence, such as the <em>Corpus Christi</em> procession, devotions to the Blessed Virgin, and the veneration of relics (the parish is currently custodian of ten relics). Anyone visiting or living in Poland should not miss particularly Polish devotions, such as the <em>Rorate</em> Masses in Advent, the <em>Gorzkie źale</em> devotion during Lent, the blessing of Easter Baskets on Holy Saturday, and pilgrimages to Częstochowa in August, to name a few. Because St Charles Borromeo is a Franciscan parish, you can also experience the moving <em>Transitus</em> ritual on the evening of October 3rd, when Franciscans ritually remember the passing of St Francis of Assisi from this life into God.</p>
<p>The parish of St Charles Borromeo warmly welcomes English-speakers not only to the English Mass, but to participate in the larger life of the parish. Even if you do not speak Polish, you can still find the Spirit of God in the beauty and reverence of the liturgy and devotions, in the rhythms of the liturgical year, and in the example of faith of your fellow parishioners and our Franciscan priests and brothers.
