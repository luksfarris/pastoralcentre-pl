<h1>Welcome to the Pastoral Centre!</h1>
<p>The Pastoral Centre was established in April, 2007 at St. Charles Borromeo Parish in Wrocław by Archbishop Marian Gołębiewski, to meet the pastoral needs of English-speaking foreigners in the diocese. The Conventual Franciscan Friars of St. Charles parish are responsible for the Pastoral Centre.</p>
<p>The Pastoral Centre welcomes anyone who speaks English and needs the sacraments or pastoral care. If you are a Catholic seeking Mass in English; if you want to have your wedding celebrated in English, or you need to complete missing sacraments (First Communion, Confirmation); if you need confession or a priest’s advice in English; or if you are a non-Catholic English-speaker who is interested in the Catholic Church, we welcome you and invite you to the <strong>English Mass at 16:00 every Sunday</strong> <span style="color: #000000;">(18:00 in June, July and August)</span>.</p>
