<h2>Receiving a Plenary Indulgence during the Year of Faith</h2>
<p>On 14 September 2012, the Apostolic Penitentiary decreed that during the Year of Faith (October 11, 2012 – November 24, 2013), it would be possible for the faithful to receive a plenary indulgence from temporal punishment for their sins (the indulgence may also be offered for the souls of the faithful departed).</p>
<p>In order to receive the indulgence, the usual conditions apply:</p>
<p>1. Making a full sacramental confession</p>
<p>2. Receiving Holy Communion</p>
<p>3. Praying for the intentions of the Holy Father.</p>
<p>In addition, for this indulgence, the faithful must fulfil one of the following conditions:</p>
<p>1. Attending three lectures during Mass in a Parish Mission on any subject; or three lectures on the Documents of Vatican II or the Catechism of the Catholic Church, in a church or other designated place.</p>
<p>2. Making a pilgrimage to a Papal Basilica, the Catacombs or a Christian sanctuary designated by the Bishop of the Diocese during the Year of Faith and taking part in a liturgical worship service there; or pray or meditate, ending with the Our Father, the Creed, and a prayer invoking the Blessed Virgin or another saint. This can be done on any day in the Year of Faith.</p>
<p><em>St Charles Borromeo parish is a ‘designated sanctuary’ because of the Shrine of Our Lady of Grace. This means that if we make a good confession, receive communion and pray for the Holy Father as well as participating in some kind of liturgical worship (Mass, organized worship like a litany or other worship service) in St Charles Church on any day during the Year of Faith, we gain the indulgence.</em></p>
