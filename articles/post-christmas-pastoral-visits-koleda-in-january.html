<div class="post-content">
<p>First-time visitors to Poland often wonder why Christmas decorations are kept up until February and Christmas Carols are sung in Mass throughout January, even when the liturgical calendar indicates we are in Ordinary Time, and the Christmas season has passed.</p>
<p>As with most peculiar cultural customs, there’s a reason why Poles extend Christmas until the Feast of the Presentation of the Lord (February 2): the<em> kolęda</em> – or literally “Christmas Carol” – pastoral visit by parish priests.</p>
<p>The Catholic <em>Code of Canon Law</em> indicates that a parish priest should know his flock personally. One way he gets to know them is by visiting them in their homes. In Poland, this requirement has become a firmly-established tradition of pastoral visits roughly between the beginning of January and the beginning of February, depending on the size of the parish and the number of homes to be visited. If you have seen the letters K+M+B (Year) or C+M+B (Year) written on the doors of Polish homes, you have seen evidence that the family living in that home has had their yearly <em>kolęda </em>— the pastoral visit by a priest from their parish.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Man-Century-Life-Times-Pope/dp/0805026886" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Man of the Century: The Life and Times of Pope John Paul II</em></a>, Jonathan Kwitny describes the <em>kolęda</em> visits of the young priest Karol Wojtyła – later Saint Pope John Paul II – in his first assignment as parish priest in the rural village of Niegowić, near Kraków. The future Pope told an old friend what the visits were like:</p>
<blockquote><p>The snow sticks to the hem of your cassock and melts when you’re indoors. Then in the open air it freezes so that the cassock is stiff and heavy and interferes with walking. By evening, you feel you can hardly go a step further, but you have to because you know the people have been waiting for this visit all year. You go in and say, “Blessed be Jesus Christ,” you greet the whole family, you pray with them and sprinkle the cottage with holy water, and the stables, too, so that the cattle will prosper during the coming year. Then you go back into the house and you can’t escape sitting and talking to everyone for a bit. (p. 113)</p></blockquote>
<p>Such could have been the description of rural <em>kolęda</em> visits across Poland in the 1940s. But what does this tradition look like nowadays, in the city, and how do you participate?</p>
<p>Normally, when there’s no pandemic, altar-servers from the parish go from building to building knocking on doors and asking residents if they want to receive the priest for a pastoral visit. Then they let the priest know which families are at home and ready for a visit; it makes the priest’s job easier. This year, because of the pandemic, people will sign up to invite a priest to come to their home on particular days. The Pastoral Centre has published <a href="https://forms.gle/RcJuDEWZzDjUwCN86" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a sign-up sheet online for members of our community who would like to welcome our priest to visit them at home.</a></p>
<p>Exactly what happens at a <em>kolęda</em> visit may vary from region to region, and each priest and the situation in each parish is different. In general, the visit is more or less the same as Pope John Paul described it: a greeting from the priest, prayer, blessing the home, a friendly talk with everyone in the family.</p>
<p>Here are some essentials to help you prepare for when our priest visits your home.</p>
<p>1. <em>Everyone in the family should be present for the visit</em>. Since the visit is a pastoral visit, the point is for the priest to meet every member of his parish in person, in their homes, to find out what their pastoral needs are, answer their questions, and make sure that everyone who wishes to be enrolled in the parish is entered on the parish’s rolls. (In the Pastoral Centre’s case, this will only happen if you live within the boundaries of Sw Karol parish.  If you live in another parish, it’s a good idea to be enrolled, while letting the priest know that you attend Mass in English.  Being enrolled in your parish means that the parish priest knows who you are and that you belong to his parish.  If you decide to get married or have  baby baptized, the priest of the parish where you live is the first person you need to consult, because according to canon law, the priest of your home parish is responsible for your spiritual needs and keeping records of your sacraments.) The priest may ask about the need for sacraments – baptism, for example, of a new baby. In the past, when religion was not taught in school, children were often a bit anxious about the <em>kolęda</em> visit, because it meant the priest would quiz them about their progress in learning their faith.</p>
<p>2. <em>Prepare your home for the visit</em>. Traditionally, people prepare for the priest’s visit by setting up something like an “altar” in the home. This can simply be on the dining or coffee table, perhaps with a white cloth on it, a Bible, <a href="https://liturgiczny.pl/zestaw-koledowy-papieski-maly-zlocony-21?utm_source=shoper&amp;utm_medium=shoper-cpc&amp;utm_campaign=shoper-kampanie-google&amp;shop_campaign=9536556021&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA5vb-BRCRARIsAJBKc6KbQB7wqoBwv0er2vH93fRqhZDXa4fA6Llk3_DXqATmv4yuf7jLsZ4aAupjEALw_wcB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a couple of candles and a crucifix</a> (usually the kind that stands upright rather than hangs on the wall). Some people provide <a href="https://allegro.pl/oferta/komplet-zestaw-koledowy-serce-koleda-pasyjka-7000804672?utm_feed=aa34192d-eee2-4419-9a9a-de66b9dfae24&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=_MD_GD_pla_bizuteria_i_zegarki(bez_zegarkow)&amp;ev_adgr=Dewocjonalia&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA5vb-BRCRARIsAJBKc6KWE82NP1TYgE1rMZWQpRo3TjKdK4I98WJ69k4Jk1nZmFhJQrnRygAaAr8pEALw_wcB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">holy water and a small ‘wand’ (aspergillum) for sprinkling it</a>, but it’s usually safe to assume that the priest will bring his own holy water. (If the priest doesn’t bring his own holy water and you don’t have any, provide ordinary water – and something to sprinkle it with – and ask the priest to bless it.  You need <em>blessed</em> water for a house blessing; not just plain water.)  You can make up your “altar” from appropriate items that you already own. If you want to buy a <em>kolęda</em> “kit,” look up “<a href="https://e-dewocjonalia.eu/pl/p/Komplet-koledowy-jasne-drewno-z-miska/1562?gclid=Cj0KCQiA5vb-BRCRARIsAJBKc6Ia56Yqs6YA3GlU4KCL2X5sYXlo4Bj1gnhVe49BK3zdea70jHuZbjEaArMvEALw_wcB" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>zestaw kolędowy</em></a>” online or ask for one in a religious goods shop.</p>
<p>Another thing you’ll need is blessed chalk. Priests bless the chalk at Mass on January 6th and it is distributed in church, or you can bring your own chalk to be blessed. The priest will use the blessed chalk at the end of the visit to write K+M+B (Year) or C+M+B (Year) on your door. There is some debate about the reason for different letters written on the door. Before the Second Vatican Council, the ritual of the blessing of the chalk said that the priest should write the names of the three saints on the door of their houses: Casper, Melchior and Balthazar. In Latin, the letters would be G+M+B (<em>in Domus suae portis scripserint nomina sanctorum tuorum Gasparis, Melchioris et Baltassar</em>…). This raises the question of why you sometimes see C+M+B written on doors after pastoral visits. The common explanation is that C+M+B is an abbreviation of the Latin phrase, “<em>Christus mansionem benedicat</em>” (Let Christ bless [the] home). Whatever the origins of the inscription, having the letters marked on your door is a testament to the world of our commitment to our Catholic Faith, and a reminder of Jesus’s promise that “Everyone who acknowledges me before others, I will acknowledge before my heavenly Father” (Mt 10:32).</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignleft wp-image-14481 size-medium" height="192" loading="lazy" src="../img/0cdabcb71ec44beea73b047abedc6300-1.jpg" width="300"/>3. <em>Participate in the prayers and blessing</em>.  Participating in the prayers and blessing means <em>turning off the television and computer and having everyone in the house silence their phones</em> so there are no interruptions  – the same as you would do in church. When the priest comes to your home, the first thing he will say is, ‘Peace to this house’ or similar words. You would answer, ‘And with your spirit,’ as you would in Mass. Chances are that if the priest realizes immediately that you are a foreigner and unfamiliar with the ritual, he will adapt to your ability to understand what he is saying. He will invite you to pray with him, perhaps the Lord’s Prayer, Hail Mary and Glory be, and he will bless the house. If you give him your blessed chalk, he will write the traditional letters and date on the outside of your door.</p>
<p>For members of the Pastoral Centre, who can request a visit by our English-speaking priest, Fr Marcin, we have prepared a text that Father will follow this year. If you keep this paper, you can read along with Fr Marcin and say the appropriate responses together.</p>
<p>1. When everyone is gathered, you all make the sign of the cross, saying, <strong>In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.</strong></p>
<p>2. The priest says, <strong>Peace be with this house and with all who live here</strong>. The people reply, <strong>And with your spirit</strong>.</p>
<p>3. The priest prepares you for the blessing in these words:</p>
<p>When Christ took flesh through the Blessed Virgin Mary, he made his home with us. Let us now pray that he will enter this home and bless it with his presence. May he always be here among you; may he nurture your love for each other, share in your joys, comfort you in your sorrows. Inspired by his teachings and example, seek to make your home before all else a dwelling place of love, diffusing far and wide the goodness of Christ.</p>
<p>4. The following text is read from sacred scripture:</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, listen to the words of the holy Gospel according to Luke:</p>
<p>The Lord said to the seventy-two, ‘Into whatever house you enter, first say, “Peace to this household.” If a peaceful person lives there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you. Stay in the same house and eat and drink what is offered to you, for the laborer deserves his payment. Do not move about from one house to another. Whatever town you enter and they welcome you, eat what is set before you, cure the sick in it and say to them, “The kingdom of God is at hand for you.”’</p>
<p>5. The assembled people will say this psalm together:</p>
<p><strong>R/ Happy are those who fear the Lord.</strong></p>
<p>Happy the man who fears the Lord,<br/>
who greatly delights in his commands.<br/>
His posterity shall be mighty upon the earth;<br/>
the upright generation shall be blessed.<strong> R/</strong></p>
<p>Wealth and riches shall be in his house;<br/>
his generosity shall endure forever.<br/>
He dawns through the darkness, a light for the upright;<br/>
he is gracious and merciful and just. <strong>R/</strong></p>
<p>Well for the man who is gracious and lends,<br/>
who conducts his affairs with justice;<br/>
He shall never be moved;<br/>
the just man shall be in everlasting remembrance. <strong>R/</strong></p>
<p>An evil report he shall not fear;<br/>
his heart is firm, trusting in the LORD.<br/>
His heart is steadfast; he shall not fear<br/>
till he looks down upon his foes. <strong>R/</strong></p>
<p>Lavishly he gives to the poor;<br/>
his generosity shall endure forever;<br/>
his horn shall be exalted in glory. <strong>R/</strong></p>
<p>6. Intercessions for the people living in the house.</p>
<p>Priest: The Son of God, Lord of heaven and earth, made his home among us. With thankfulness and gladness let us call upon him saying, ‘Stay with us, Lord.’</p>
<ol>
<li>Lord Jesus Christ, by your life with Mary and Joseph you sanctified the life of the home; dwell with us in our home, so that we may have you as our guest and honor you as our Head. For this we pray: <strong>R/ Stay with us, Lord.</strong></li>
<li>In you every dwelling grows into a holy temple; grant that those who live in this house may be built up together into the dwelling place of God in the Holy Spirit. For this we pray: <strong>R/ Stay with us, Lord.</strong></li>
<li>You taught your followers to build their houses upon solid rock; grant that the members of this family may hold fast to your teachings, and, free from all discord, serve you with their whole heart. For this we pray: <strong>R/ Stay with us, Lord</strong>.</li>
<li>You had no place to lay your head, but in uncomplaining poverty you accepted the hospitality of your friends; grant that through our help people who are homeless may obtain decent housing. For this we pray: <strong>R/ Stay with us, Lord</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>7. Prayer of blessing (priest)</p>
<p>Lord, be close to your servants who live in this house and ask for your blessing. Be their shelter when they are at home, their companion when they are away, and their welcome guest when they return. And at last receive them into the dwelling place you have prepared for them in your Father’s house, where you live forever and ever.<br/>
<strong>R/ Amen</strong>.</p>
<p>8. Sprinkling of the people and the home.</p>
<p>The priest says: Let this water call to mind our baptism into Christ, who has redeemed us by his death and resurrection.<br/>
<strong>R/ Amen</strong>.</p>
<p>9. The priest concludes by saying:</p>
<p>May the peace of Christ rule in our hearts, and may the word of Christ in all its richness dwell in us, so that whatever we do in word or in work, we will do in the name of the Lord.<br/>
<strong>R/ Amen</strong>.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the visit, you give your piece of blessed chalk to the priest, and he marks the outside of your door with the letters signifying that you have been visited by the priest this year.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-14490 size-full" height="188" loading="lazy" src="../img/47b324355831534088687b28a923d0d5-1.jpg" width="600"/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Some additional notes</em>:</p>
<p>It is customary in Poland to offer the priest a donation at the conclusion of the pastoral visit. When you are visited by a diocesan priest, the donations collected during <em>kolęda</em> visits may be divided up half to the support of the parish and half to the support of the diocese; or one-third to the parish and one-third to the diocese and one-third for the support of the priest himself. The rule varies from place to place; some parishes depend greatly on the donations at <em>kolęda</em> time for the upkeep of the parish church and meeting church expenses. When the priest is from a religious order (like our Franciscan priests), the donation is turned over to the administration of the religious community (none of the donation is for the priest personally). The amount of the donation is entirely at the discretion of the householder, and is normally given in a closed envelope with no name or identifying information (anonymously).  It is important to know that if you cannot afford a donation,  you should still have the <em>koleda</em> visit!  No one will be refused a visit because he or she can’t afford (or doesn’t want to make) a donation, since it is the parish priest’s <em>duty</em> to visit his parishioners in their homes. The priest will not (should not!) ask for a donation at any point in the visit.</p>
<p>When the priest is accompanied by altar-servers, the servers usually carry with them a box for a small donation (normally a coin) in recognition of their service during the course of the year. Depending on the parish, a proportion of this donation may be used for events involving all the servers, such as a retreat, pilgrimage, summer camp, etc., that helps develop them in their faith and service to the Church.</p>
<p>Finally, it is always hospitable to offer the priest something to eat or drink, but just be aware that in normal years, he will have many homes to visit and often cannot spend more than about 15 minutes in each home (and might be offered refreshments in every home). So if you’d like to offer the priest more elaborate hospitality, the <em>kolęda</em> visit is a great opportunity to invite the priest to come back again for a meal or for tea when he can spend more time.</p>
