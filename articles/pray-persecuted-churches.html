<p>“If one part suffers, every part suffers with it…” (<a class="verseLink 47_12_26_0_0_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=1+corinthians+12:26" target="_blank">I Corinthians 12:26</a>).</p>
<p>“Remember those in prison, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering” (<a class="verseLink 59_13_3_0_0_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=hebrews+13:3" target="_blank">Hebrews 13:3</a>).</p>
<p>“Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when people insult you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.” (<a class="verseLink 41_5_10_0_12_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=matthew+5:10-12" target="_blank">Matthew 5:10-12</a>).</p>
<p>“Some faced jeers and flogging, while still others were chained and put in prison. They were stoned; they were sawed in two; they were put to death by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated — the world was not worthy of them.” (<a class="verseLink 59_11_36_0_38_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=hebrews+11:36-38" target="_blank">Hebrews 11:36-38</a>)</p>
<p>“But before all this, they will lay hands on you and persecute you. They will deliver you to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors, and all on account of my name…. You will be betrayed even by parents, siblings, relatives, and friends, and they will put some of you to death. All people will hate you because of me. But not a hair of your head will perish. By standing firm you will gain life.” (<a class="verseLink 43_21_12_0_14_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=luke+21:12-14" target="_blank">Luke 21:12-14</a>)</p>
<p>“Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? …. No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” Amen. (<a class="verseLink 46_8_35_0_38_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=romans+8:35-38" target="_blank">Romans 8:35-38</a>).</p>
<p><strong>4. Pray formal prayers composed especially for the suffering Church:</strong></p>
<p><em>For all who suffer persecution:</em></p>
<p>Father in Heaven, you make your sun shine on good and bad alike.<br/>
Your Son Jesus Christ died for us all and in his glorious Resurrection He still retains the five wounds of his Passion.<br/>
With his divine power he now sustains all those who suffer persecution and martyrdom for the sake of their fidelity to the faith of the Church.</p>
<p>Merciful and mighty Father, do not allow Cain to return again to murder helpless Abel, innocent Abel.<br/>
May persecuted Christians around the world remain, like Mary, their Mother, together at the foot of the cross of Christ the Martyr.<br/>
Comfort those menaced by violence and those oppressed by uncertainty.</p>
<p>May your Holy Spirit of love make fruitful the witness and the blood of those who die forgiving.<br/>
Amen.</p>
<p><em>For Syria:</em></p>
<p>“God of mercy, hear the cry of the Syrian people, comfort those who are suffering because of the violence, console those who mourn their dead, convert the hearts of those who have taken up arms, protect those who are committed to peace. God of hope, inspire leaders to choose peace instead of violence and to seek reconciliation with their enemies.”</p>

<p>God of all grace and mercy, we turn to you in this time of sorrow and deep concern.<br/>
We pray for the situation in Egypt. For all those in that nation who have seen their lives destroyed by violence, prejudice and hatred we ask for protection, healing and restoration.<br/>
Loving Lord, you are always moved by compassion, so we pray for your compassion to fall as waters of hope to those who feel hopeless.<br/>
May your strong arms, O God, bring strength to those who no longer have the energy or will to stand. We pray for the weak, vulnerable and broken.<br/>
You are the one who walks beside the lonely and frightened. May the isolated feel your presence beside them, walking, weeping and sharing with them.<br/>
We pray for your Church in Egypt that it may know the prayers and support of the worldwide Church and that its pain is known and shared by you and others across the world. Please allow your people to know that, in this time of trial, they are not forgotten.<br/>
Gracious God of peace raise up peacemakers within Egypt, bring forth people of courage with a vision of life and a future. We ask you to come and heal this land.</p>
<p>God of peace, bring peace.<br/>
God of mercy, have mercy.<br/>
God of restoration, restore hope.<br/>
Amen.</p>
