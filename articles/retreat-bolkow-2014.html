</div>
<p>On February 28th and March 1st, a small group from the Pastoral Centre went to Bolków, about 80 km south-west of Wrocław. Bolków is a small town with a history (and a castle) going back to the 13th century.</p>
<p>We left Wrocław Friday afternoon and once we got free of the city’s rush-hour traffic, we were soon walking along Bolków’s clean, quiet, cobbled streets on our way to the convent of the Sisters of St Joseph where we would spend our retreat.</p>

</p><div class="collapseomatic_content" id="target-id1173">
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Sisters of St Joseph were founded by Fr Zygmunt Gorazdowski on 17 February 1884. Originally, the sisters took care of the homeless, the terminally ill and convalescents. In 1892 they opened a home for abandoned children and single mothers with infants and in 1899 they opened an orphanage in Krosno. The sisters expanded their work to include day camps, summer camps and schools and literacy and vocational courses. During World War I they joined the Red Cross and worked in field hospitals. By 1939 the sisters were working in 8 hospitals, as well as running health centres and clinics and visiting the sick in their homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">At the outbreak of World War II, there were 45 Josephite communities, but only 11 survived the War. Approximately 200 sisters were displaced or deported; some were martyred or were killed during the War while carrying out their charitable work helping the displaced, wounded, and sick and saving the lives of Russians and Jews. Consistent with their original charism, the sisters took special care of hungry and orphaned children during the War, organizing children’s homes, nurseries, care for mothers and children, and shelters for demoralized and abandoned boys. The sisters rescued many children from hunger and disease.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In 1946, when Poland’s borders shifted, the congregation lost its motherhouse in Lwów, while political conditions in post-War Poland restricted the activities of all religious congregations, including the sisters of St Joseph. In the 1960s the sisters were barred from working in hospitals, kindergartens and some facilities for children and the elderly. They focused on the care of children with special needs, the physically and mentally disabled, and nursing in psychiatric hospitals, as well as engaging in catechetical work in parishes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">In 1973 the Sisters of St Joseph founded their first house outside of Poland, in Italy. In 1975 they established a mission in the Congo and in 1983 in Brazil. With the political changes in Poland in 1989, the sisters were free to return to work in accordance with their charism. In 1991, the order was allowed to return to Ukraine, the country of their founding. Currently the congregation has about 500 sisters in two provinces in Poland as well as in Ukraine, Africa and Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Wrocław Province of the Sisters of St Joseph has 17 houses and 179 sisters. They carry out the mission of the Congregation handed down to them by their founder. They take care of children and young people who are physically disabled and mentally challenged, and look after the sick in hospitals, factories and through home visits. They run nurseries and community centres and are involved in the pastoral care and catechetical formation of youth. Sisters of St Joseph also serve in parishes as sacristans or organists. Lay people who wish to live the charism of the Sisters of St Joseph can join Prayer Groups organized by various Josephite communities.</span></p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">Gathered in Front of the Convent</p>
</div>
<p>We were greeted by the surprisingly young Mother Superior, and Fr Krzysztof showed us up to our rooms, which were rather unusual. The Sisters run programs for disadvantaged children in the town, and the rooms reflect that: most of them have at least a few bunk-beds in them, so we could be like Goldilocks choosing a bed that is ‘just right.’ That done, we headed downstairs to a communal meal and Fr Krzysztof outlined the plan for the retreat. The approach was simple with a focus on silence and prayer and plenty of time for private time, quiet reflection and rest; perfect after a long, busy week in the city.</p>

<p>Although the convent is just a few steps from the Church of St Jadwiga, we had the privilege of using the Sisters’ small chapel. Fr Krzysztof organized four hours of adoration of the Blessed Sacrament for Friday evening. We began together singing ‘O Saving Victim’ and the litany to the Blessed Sacrament, and then – silence. Each person could spend as much time as he or she wished or come and go until 11PM, when we sang ‘Tantum Ergo’ and were blessed with the Blessed Sacrament: could there be any better way to insure a peaceful night’s rest?</p>

<p>Saturday morning we gathered in the Sisters’ chapel to start the day with prayers and a private Mass for retreatants. As always, the first reading and prayers of the faithful were read and the psalm was sung by different people on the retreat and Fr Krzysztof prepared a homily for us. Thanks to modern technology, at breakfast we were able to talk to two of our friends who could not join us on the retreat because they were at home in India. It was a pleasure to see them again, if only via the Internet on a Smartphone. After breakfast we had free time, which provided a surprisingly rare opportunity for some of us to just talk and get to know one another better.</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">A little talk about the importance of relationship</p>
</div>
<p>Around 9:30 we all gathered together in the children’s activity room for a talk by Fr Krzysztof, who invited us to reflect on how we got to where we are today: the relationships and chance meetings that have been important in our lives, to guide us, to help us see our true talents and abilities, to help us make key decisions and even sometimes to challenge us when we need to improve.</p>

<p>After our meeting, we had free time until lunch, when we could relax, pray, meditate, or consult with Fr Krzysztof. We gathered together again for the mid-day meal, followed by an outing to the local castle.</p>
<p>Although it’s largely in ruins, nevertheless, what remains allows a visitor to get a good sense of what it must have looked like and how it might have functioned when it was in daily use. We climbed up to the highest tower for panoramic views across the rooftops of Bolków, rolling green fields and another castle not very far away. It was a perfect, clear, sunny day and there were very few visitors at the castle – ideal conditions to roam around and take our time exploring every part of the complex.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_3687" style="width: 226px"><a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Bolkow-Castle-entrance-view.jpg"><img alt="Yes, we climbed all the way up to the top of that!" class="wp-image-3687" height="162" sizes="(max-width: 216px) 100vw, 216px" src="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Bolkow-Castle-entrance-view-300x225.jpg" srcset="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Bolkow-Castle-entrance-view-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Bolkow-Castle-entrance-view-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Bolkow-Castle-entrance-view-1000x750.jpg 1000w" width="216"/></a>

<p>We returned to the convent in time to pray the Divine Mercy Chaplet together in the chapel, and then to have more quiet time until our last meal together. We concluded our retreat by praying vespers prayers together before saying good-bye to the sisters and heading back to Wrocław. All in all, a most restful, restorative retreat and a beautiful way to prepare for the beginning of Lent.</p>

<p>The town of Bolków has suffered economically from various factors, including the closing of the railway station.  The Sisters of St Joseph do important work helping youngsters who come from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Every day after school, the children can go to the convent where they are welcomed and provided a safe place to get help with their homework and the care and attention they are not able to get at home.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Sisters do not have enough money to keep their after-school centre open.  They have been promised a sum of money, but even if they get it, they will still need at least 5,000 zloties more in order to continue their work with children in Bolków.</p>
<p>Please consider making a donation to the Sisters of St Joseph in Bolków. You can make a donation by bank transfer either at your bank or at the post office.  If you’re unsure how to do it, <a href="http://swietlica-xzg.cba.pl/?page_id=40" target="_blank" title="Help the Sisters of St Joseph in Bolków!">take down the Centre’s name and address and their bank and account number from this website</a>, and ask a Polish friend for assistance.
