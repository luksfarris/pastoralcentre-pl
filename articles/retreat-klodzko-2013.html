<p>We all met at the Wroclaw Main Bus Station on Friday 24th May for a much-needed Retreat to nearby Kłodzko. The bus to Kłodzko left at approximately 4.40pm and we made our way through all the Friday afternoon traffic and headed out of Wrocław to Kłodzko, which is on the road to the nearby Czech Republic. The journey by bus was very pleasant and in no time at all we had arrived at our destination.</p>

<p>After gathering our suitcases we made our way on foot into town via the Franciscan friary (with a quick peek into the church) which had been badly damaged by the floods of 1997. From there we made our way through the lovely Rynek to the cloister of the Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration.</p>
<p>We were greeted by the friendly extern sister and then shown our cosy and comfortable rooms – single rooms upstairs and a larger room for a family downstairs.</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">…and cake! Don’t forget to mention the cake!</p>
</div>
<p>We had our own private kitchen, which had been well stocked by the Sisters for our overnight stay. When we arrived it was time for supper and so we gathered around our table, which was laden with such lovely delights, all specially prepared by the Sisters. We had hot soup to start followed by “krokietki” and then of course lots of cheese, bread and fruit.</p>
<p>Once we had all had our fill it was time for some singing followed by Adoration. Father Krzysztof wanted us to practice our hymns for Mass in English the next day.</p>

</div>
<p>Because the Sisters have perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, we were able to go in and out of the church throughout the night and stay for as long as we wanted. The Sisters have their own part of the church behind the altar where they can adore the Blessed Eucharist and we were in the main body of the church. As there are too few sisters to be constantly keeping vigil some people from the parish congregation come in to relieve the sisters, so all through the night there is a constant vigil before the Blessed Sacrament. It is really very special and it is so wonderful to kneel in adoration in the peace and quiet of such beautiful surroundings.</p>
<p>The next morning we had English Mass at 7.30am and, followed by breakfast. We then set off to the Franciscan friary where we were greeted by one of the Brothers, who showed us the dining hall with its magnificent artwork.</p>

<p>This room had suffered a lot of damage in the flood and we were able to see the water marks about 3m high where the water had poured in. Tens of thousands of the friary’s valuable books were destroyed during the flood. Particularly amazing are the paintings on the ceiling which depict religious scenes. We were all in awe as we moved around the room and looked at the scenes, since the pictures changed as we moved, for example, they followed us with their eyes, or the people depicted seemed to move from facing one way to facing another way.</p>
<p>After leaving the friary, we made our way up to the main fortress. We bought our tickets and followed pebbled paths through the fortress and up to a lovely vantage point where we could view the whole town and its surroundings.</p>

<p>This Fortress was also used for prisoners during the Second World War and so its walls hold many a dark tale. We saw a room filled with a variety of torture implements which had the children all asking questions and also a diorama of the hospital that had served the garrison in the 18th and early 19th centuries. One of the patients was having his leg amputated, with plenty of fake blood and no anaesthetic, so quite a grisly scene! This was depicted in one room while next door other patients were playing a game of cards (to take their minds off the screaming, one assumes).</p>

<p>Most of the group (apart from two claustrophobics) went down into the labyrinth underneath the Fortress complex. Apparently, there are many miles of secret tunnels all in the dark and some with only crawling space. Not my cup of tea, but this was definitely enjoyed by the majority. The two of us who did not go down into the tunnels proceeded back into town for a cosy cup of hot chocolate. We had caught sight of this delightful little coffee shop on our way up to the Fortress earlier and had decided that this was definitely worth a visit.</p>

<p>The town or Rynek is quite small with such a variety of quaint shops that one can spend the whole day just strolling around from shop to shop. Unfortunately, we did not have enough time and so we will have to make plans for a return trip (hint, hint Fr Krzysztof!).</p>

<p>We all met back at our cloister for lunch. Another wonderful feast prepared by the sisters: tomato soup, fried fish, roast chicken, and the list goes on. After our active morning we partook of this meal heartily. With lunch over, we were able to have a chat with some of the Sisters and the Mother Superior. We all had questions which they eagerly answered and then we closed with a little photo session.</p>

<p>We finished around 3pm in time for the Chaplet of Divine Mercy in the church, and this time we were accompanied by some of the Sisters. We could not see them, but they sang and played the guitar. We recited a decade in English and then they sang the next decade in Polish. At the end of the chaplet they continued to sing and play the guitar; it was really beautiful.</p>

</div>
<p>From about 3.30pm we had some free time. Fr Krzysztof was available for a private chat and we took a stroll around the Sisters’ garden before visiting their little shop, where we were able to purchase some of the items that the Sisters make by hand. There were gift cards, vestments, rosaries, embroidered pictures and much more all hand-stitched by the Sisters in what little free time they have.</p>

<p>Then it was time for supper and yet again plates of food all so lovingly prepared were brought in to us. We all enjoyed our last meal together and before long it was time to pack up and leave our lovely calm surroundings and head back to the hustle and bustle of the big city. We said our farewells, and were just in time to catch our bus back to Wrocław.</p>
<p>It was such an enjoyable time, all spent together, eating, talking and most importantly praying!</p>
<p>Thank you Fr Krzyzstof for yet another wonderful retreat!</p>
