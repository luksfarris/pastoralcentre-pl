<p><em>All men were by nature foolish who were in ignorance of God,</em><br/>
<em>And who from the good things seen did not succeed in knowing him who is,</em><br/>
<em>and from studying the works did not discern the artisan; </em><br/>
<em>but either fire or wind or the swift air</em><br/>
<em>or the circuit of the stars or of the mighty water</em><br/>
<em>or the luminaries of heaven, the governors of the world, they considered gods. </em><br/>
<em>Now if out of joy in their beauty they thought them gods, </em><br/>
<em>let them know how far more excellent is the Lord than these; </em><br/>
<em>for the original source of beauty fashioned them.</em> (Wisdom 13: 1-3)</p>
<p>The first reading from the liturgy for Friday of the thirty-second week in Ordinary Time (Year I), set an appropriate theme for our short retreat in the region of Pieszyce at the foot of the Owl Mountains (Gór Sowich) Friday and Saturday 15/ 16 November.  Whereas those people spoken of in the Book of Wisdom were surrounded by the beauties of nature and could not discern from them the existence of God, we moderns living in Wrocław are usually insulated from meaningful contact with nature.  We don’t see the sun rise and set; the stars are obscured by light pollution in the city; and even walking down rare a tree-lined street, we may not be able to hear bird-song.  Absorbed in our busy lives and surrounded by buildings and concrete, we often don’t get time to slow down, look around us at the glories of nature and raise our hearts to thought of God, the Source and Origin of all beauty. Our mini-retreat at the Convent of the Salesian Sisters in Pieszyce was an opportunity to leave the city behind, get in touch with nature, slow down, and reconnect with God.</p>

<p>We left Friday afternoon from the friary, with Fr Krzysztof at the wheel of the friars’ mini-van and headed out of town to Pieszyce, where we were welcomed by the Mother Superior of the Salesians and shown up to our rooms. We settled in, and then reconvened in the guest dining room for a light supper, during which Fr Krzysztof gave a brief reflection about the readings for the day (Wisdom 13:1-9, <a class="verseLink 19_19_2_0_3_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=psalms+19:2-3" target="_blank">Psalm 19:2-3</a>, 4-5, <a class="verseLink 43_17_26_0_37_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=luke+17:26-37" target="_blank">Luke 17:26-37</a>) and proposed a theme for our own reflections and prayers on the retreat: our retreat could be a time when, in the midst of natural beauty, we turned our thoughts again to the Creator, and away from all the hubbub and busyness that distracts us in daily life.</p>

<p>After supper, we went to the chapel, where a Salesian Sister and a group of teens were having adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. We had time for quiet prayer and prayed the Divine Mercy Chaplet before retiring to our rooms for an early night after – for most of us – a hectic and busy work-week (with the option of returning to the chapel throughout the night for private prayer).</p>
<p>Saturday morning, we celebrated Mass together and had breakfast before leaving Pieszyce and driving in the direction of  the village of Sierpnice in the Owl Mountains. Along the way we entered into a valley of thick, pea-soup fog, before ascending above the fog to discover clear skies, sunshine and a glorious landscape of evergreens and golden fallen autumn leaves – the Owl Mountains certainly tell the glory of God by their beauty!</p>

<p>Near Sierpnice, we took a guided tour of a a small part of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Riese" target="_blank" title="Learn more on Wikipedia">mysterious underground complex created by the Nazis beginning in 1943</a>.  The complex of tunnels and ‘rooms’ or ‘halls’ was hewn out of the living rock by prisoners of war and others held in the Gross-Rosen concentration camp in the region. The workers lived in extremely primitive conditions (first simply in trenches or dugouts; later in flimsy wooden barracks they built themselves). Living on near-starvation rations, dressed in completely inadequate clothing, with no protective gear, these slave-laborers might walk as much as two kilometers before reaching their work station each day (and then walk back again at night). They used only the most primitive of tools, but managed to remove tons of rock to create tunnels and caverns, some of which were ultimately finished with concrete.</p>

<p>No one knows exactly the intended use of these underground facilities. It is conjectured that Hitler intended to link three of them under different mountains into one vast complex. But the purpose of the complexes remains obscure. Some think that they might have provided a secret military headquarters for Hitler; others that the spaces were intended to be used as munitions factories or even for the development of ultra-secret weapons. We may never know the whole truth, since toward the end of the War, the Nazis had time to remove virtually every sign of any secret or industrial use that they might have made of the underground complex.</p>

<p>Perhaps because it was impossible to know exactly what the underground ‘city’ was intended for – or perhaps because our English-speaking guide was so engaging and interesting – our time in the tunnels and subterranean rooms did not seem as ominous and threatening as a visit to a concentration camp (though being in a cave always feels a bit creepy). It was difficult to imagine the hundreds or even thousands who must have died creating – in a short time, with great urgency – the vast complex inside the mountain. They worked furiously, and lived like animals just to survive. Now, all that’s left of their heroic efforts is a baffling tourist attraction. It is known that there are sealed-off areas – entire rooms or ‘halls’ – in the complex, but existing laws forbid tunneling into them to see if they yield any clues about the purpose of the building or shed light on Hitler’s plans during or after the War. One prisoner did manage to write and preserve a record of his time working on the underground complex. It is to be hoped that in future, the authorities managing the site will use his memoirs to give visitors a better sense of what the slave-laborers endured in excavating what now seems to be a vast folly. Until that day, the underground cities in the Owl Mountains seem as senseless and wasteful of life as war itself.</p>

<p>Coming out into the welcome sunshine again, we said good-bye to our guide and carried on a short way into the mountains to the village of Jugów, where we parked and walked down to a hostel/ski lodge called ‘Zygmuntówka’ (in English, we decided, it would be ‘Ziggy’s Place’). This is a popular stop for hikers, skiers (both cross-country and downhill) and for cyclists (on paths that become cross-country ski lanes in winter). Zygmuntówka has seen more prosperous days, but it was still a pleasant, rustic spot to stop for a hot drink and conversation. After our break at Ziggy’s, we split up for private walks in the surrounding hills, to look at the views, be close to nature, and get in touch with God and ourselves before heading back to Pieszyce in time to pray Divine Mercy and share a well-earned and hearty meal prepared by the Sisters.</p>
<p>After a couple of more hours to rest, pray and – if desired – consult with Fr Krzysztof about spiritual matters, we left the hospitable Sisters and returned to Wrocław, tired but refreshed, and as always, looking forward to another opportunity to retreat from daily life in the bustling city.</p>
