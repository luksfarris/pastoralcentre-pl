<p>Thanks to Fr.

<p>We were greeted at the Poor Clares’ convent by smiles the young extern, Sister Dominika, who took care of us during our stay. Sister Dominika led us the top floor of the guests’ side of the convent, where we chose our rooms. (In choosing rooms together at the end of the corridor, the three women had no idea that while we would be sharing a suite of two full bathrooms with shower, a WC and a separate bathing-room, the four men would be queuing to share one small bathroom with shower at their end of the hall. When we realized this shortly before our departure on Saturday, the amusement of the ladies was in keeping with the spirit of a retreat: it was heavenly).</p>

<p>The Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration are a cloistered order (the same order as Mother Angelica of EWTN), so we did not meet the talented sister who prepared supper and all the delicious meals we enjoyed during our stay. After supper we went to the Church for common adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. The church is arranged with the Blessed Sacrament exposed continually above the tabernacle (it is covered with a cloth during Masses). Behind the monstrance there is a wall with a window, and on the other side of this wall, the sisters have their adoration room, where they pray in shifts all night long and regularly during the day. The muted sound of their prayers can be heard in the silence of the church. We were privileged to have access to the church all night by passing through the sisters’ intricate Renaissance-style garden between the cloister and the side-entrance of the church. (The custom is that the last retreatant to leave the church during the night rings the altar bells, which summons one of the sisters through a door in the wall between the sisters’ adoration chapel and the church. This sister turns off the lights in the church and bolts the door for the night.)</p>
<p>Although we only had one full day in Ząbkowice, Fr. Krzysztof had arranged it so well that the day was full, with plenty of time for prayer individually and as a group, private free time, and optional activities in the town. He taught us (or tried to; his ‘class’ was a little hilarious) how to ‘chant’ (sort of) the prayers of the Divine Office, and we did our best during shared morning and afternoon prayers, men on one side of the aisle, women on the other. We learned well enough to attempt to chant our thanks to Fr. Krzysztof at the end of the retreat, but had a little trouble remembering our lines. Maybe next time we’ll do better.</p>
<p>After breakfast and a private Mass in English, we gathered to discuss a chapter from <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Religious-Sense-Luigi-Giussani/dp/0773516263" target="_blank">The Religious Sense</a></strong> by Luigi Guissani. It was interesting, and since as Fr. Krzysztof said, it was not Holy Scripture and it was not a mortal sin to disagree with the author, the discussion was…lively at times. After dinner and free time, we were able to gather in the church for the Chaplet of Divine Mercy prayed together in English – an opportunity none of us had ever had in Poland before.</p>

<p>As it happens, Ząbkowice was sponsoring a medieval festival, and in our free hours before supper the group went out to see the historic sights of the city and visit the festival. Our first stop was the famous leaning tower: 139 medieval steps (translation: no two steps – and no section of ceiling – the same height) with the reward of panoramic views of the city and countryside from the top. When we reached the top and Fr. Krzystof was not right behind us, there was a moment of doubt that perhaps he knew about a secret lift he hadn’t mentioned to us, but he had only stayed below to pick up souvenir brochures for the group before climbing up after us to point out the landmarks visible from the tower.</p>
<p>The medieval festival was small enough to be enjoyable (we could see the action, not just crowds). For awhile we watched ‘knights’ battling with swords. It was a bit like American football is to the uninitiated: heavily padded men rushing aggressively at one another, knocking each other about, scoring points on a mysterious basis, and a winner announced in the end. There was a concert of medieval music, a dance exhibition, an encampment of Czech participants in costume, with tents and crafts on display (accompanied by a horse who seemed to be laughing and putting out his tongue at us, and a dog who wasn’t even trying to be medieval). There were souvenirs available; not the relics and indulgences one reads about in medieval literature, but wooden shields and swords, stamped ‘coins’, pottery, ‘princess’ headgear for little girls, and hand-made medieval-style shoes with extremely pointy toes. (We could not convince Fr. Krzysztof that these would go great with his medieval-looking Franciscan habit; even the snazzy papal-red pair with curled-up toes were deemed ‘not my style’, alas.)</p>

<p>After the medieval festival, there was still time to visit ‘Frankenstein’s laboratory’ which had been set up as a ‘haunted house’ for festival-goers. (The town was called ‘Frankenstein’ before World War II, and while there’s no real connection with Mary Shelley’s book of the same name, no one seems to care.) Those of us who remained outside heard high-pitched screams during the short tour of the house, but were assured that it was ‘only children’ on the tour, and not our group, who were frightened.</p>
<p>Back at the convent, we had a last meal together and leave-taking with Sister Dominika, but before we left, there was a meeting with the Mother Superior, to thank her for the sisters’ hospitality. She assured us of the community’s prayers for the Pastoral Center.</p>
<p>Fr. Krzysztof has plans for more such retreats, possibly even every month, and judging from the peace, prayer, good fellowship and good humor enjoyed on this retreat, they are sure to be successful.</p>
<p>Thank you Fr. Krzysztof!
