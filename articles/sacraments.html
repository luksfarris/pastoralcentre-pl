<div class="pf-content">The Pastoral Centre for English-Speakers was created to provide for the pastoral care of all English-speaking Catholics in the Diocese of Wroclaw, who cannot get their pastoral needs met in Polish or in their own native-language.<p></p>
<p>This means that the <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/parish/our-priests/">priests</a> of the Pastoral Centre are ready to provide or arrange for the reception of the following sacraments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confession</li>
<li>Baptism</li>
<li>Marriage</li>
<li>First Communion for baptized Catholics who have not yet received this sacrament</li>
<li>Confirmation for Catholics who have not yet completed the sacraments of initiation</li>
<li>Anointing of the Sick for those facing serious illness, operations, or those in danger of death</li>
</ul>
<h1>Confession</h1>
<p>Confession is available before the Mass.  Sometimes an English-speaking priest will be in the confessional, and you need only approach him and ask for confession.  Other times, depending on the English-speaking priests’ duties, it may be necessary to go to the sacristy before Mass and ask the priest celebrating the Mass to hear your confession.  Bear in mind that Mass needs to start on time.  Usually, someone connected with the English Mass is available in the church about one-half hour before Mass begins.  If you want confession before Mass, it is best to arrive early, go to the sacristy and ask for the priest.  If he’s not yet in the sacristy, someone can usually call him to come to the church and hear your confession so he will still have enough time to begin Mass on schedule.</p>
<p>Confession is also available by appointment. <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/contact/">Contact</a> the rector of the Pastoral Centre by telephone or <a href="mailto:contact@pastoralcentre.pl">email</a> and he will arrange to meet you.  In times when many people are requesting confession – first Fridays, Advent, Lent – making an appointment is often the most sensible and convenient way to be sure that you get to confession.</p>
<p>Depending on the availability of the parish priests, it may sometimes be possible for native-speakers of Russian, Spanish or Italian to have confession with a priest who also speaks their language.  If you would like to arrange for confession in a language other than English, contact the rector of the Pastoral Centre, and he will try to arrange it with another priest.</p>
<h1>Baptisms and Weddings</h1>
<p>Detailed information about <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/sacraments/baptisms/">Baptisms</a> and <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/sacraments/weddings/">Weddings</a> is available in the ‘sacraments’ section of this website.</p>
<h1>First Communion and Confirmation</h1>
<p>Baptized Catholics who need First Communion or Confirmation should <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/contact/">contact</a> the rector of the Pastoral Centre who will have to meet with them and make special arrangements for the reception of those sacraments, depending on individual circumstances.  The process may include instruction in the Faith and consultation with the Bishop’s Office in the diocese.</p>
<h1>Anointing of the Sick</h1>
<p>If you are seriously ill or facing surgery and are in need of Anointing of the Sick, <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/contact/">contact</a> the rector of the Pastoral Centre as the need arises.</p>
<h1>Non-Catholics</h1>
<p>Non-Catholics who are interested in entering the Catholic Church need to go through a complete process of initiation and instruction in the Faith before being admitted to the sacraments (this includes Holy Communion, which should not be received by non-Catholics who attend Catholic Mass out of interest in becoming Catholic).</p>
<p>If you are an English-speaking non-Catholic who feels drawn to the Catholic Church, you are most welcome by the Pastoral Centre for English-Speakers.  So far, we have welcomed three new members to the Catholic Faith since we began our ministry to English-speakers in 2007.  We are ready to answer your questions and guide you through the process of faith formation leading to full reception into the Catholic Faith through the sacraments of initiation: <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/sacraments/baptisms/">Baptism</a>, First Communion and Confirmation.  Please <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/contact/">contact</a> the Pastoral Centre by approaching the priest after Mass, or by telephone or <a href="mailto:contact@pastoralcentre.pl">e-mail</a>.
