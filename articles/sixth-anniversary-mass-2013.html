<div class="post-content">
<p>On 21 April we welcomed Bishop Andrzej Siemieniewski to celebrate with us the sixth anniversary of the inauguration of the Pastoral Centre for English Speakers. In his greeting, Fr Krzysztof recalled Bishop Andrzej’s continued support and encouragement of the mission of the Pastoral Centre over the years:</p>
<p><em>Thank you for being bishop to those who gather around the altar of Christ here to pray together in the same language. Your presence today brings to life for us the words of</em> Lumen Gentium:</p>
<p><em>“In the bishops…for whom priests are assistants, Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Supreme High Priest, is present in the midst of those who believe.” “[B]ishops in an eminent and visible way sustain the roles of Christ Himself as Teacher, Shepherd and High Priest, and…they act in His person” (</em>Lumen Gentium 21<em>).</em></p>
<p><em>We welcome you to our international community and ask you to offer this Holy Mass so that we can grow individually and as a community, in faith, hope and love.</em></p>

<p>The 4th Sunday of Easter was Good Shepherd Sunday. Speaking on this theme in his <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/homilies-archive/" target="_blank" title="Homilies Archive">homily</a>, Bishop Andrzej emphasized how all Catholics are called to be ‘Good Shepherds’ in our lives:</p>
<p><em>In the Catholic Christian community we find mutual support, encouragement, and companionship. We cannot belong to Jesus without also belonging to His flock. The privilege of belonging is not something that is offered to a chosen few, but to everyone.</em></p>
<p><em>Pastors of the Church, priests, are our shepherds. But we all have responsibilities toward each other because it has pleased God to save us and make us holy, not merely as individuals without any mutual bonds, but by forming us into a single community, the Body of Christ.</em></p>
<p><em>So every Catholic may in some way participate in the role of the good shepherd.</em></p>
<p><em>First of all, the parents. It is their privilege and duty to teach and guide their children, to care for them, to love them, and teach them about their faith. Parents need to realize that Christ, the Good Shepherd, wants to live and act within them for the sake of their children.</em></p>
<p><em>Next are our teachers and all who care for the young. Young people desperately need upstanding role-models, good shepherds who will help them grow up to make good moral choices.</em></p>
<p><em>Those who cannot provide active help to others but who dedicate themselves to prayer for those in need are also good shepherds.</em></p>
<p><em>We ourselves are good shepherds by our faithfulness to Sunday Mass and our prayer life, by our active involvement in the parish to support the young, by protecting and helping one another, and by our charitable speech.  </em></p>

<p>After Mass, Bishop Andrzej was welcomed to join the congregation at a reception in the parish cafe. As always, Pani Dorota set a beautiful table. As a memento of his visit, Bishop Andrzej gave everyone present holy cards with the legend, ‘Mary, Mother of the New Evangelization, lead us on the way of faith’ and an image of the Madonna and Child on the front. On the reverse the cards read: ‘The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control’ (Gal 5:22). It includes the Bishop’s coat of arms with his episcopal motto, ‘Deus Caritas Est’ (God is love) and the Bishop’s blessing.</p>
<p>After a blessing of the refreshments provided by members of the Pastoral Centre, everyone sat down to enjoy catching up with old friends and making new ones.</p>

<p>The following message was sent to all the priests who have served in the Pastoral Centre over the past years: Fr Piotr Tymko, Fr Darek Sowa, Fr Daniel Zdebik, Fr Staszek Stec, Fr Krzysztof Kukułka and Fr Andrzej Kulczycki:</p>
<p><em>Dear Fathers,</em></p>
<p><em>As we celebrate the sixth anniversary of the Pastoral Centre for English Speakers, we remember your presence among us and your faithful care of the needs of the English-speakers in the Diocese of Wrocław.</em></p>
<p><em>Although we come from many different countries, through your priestly service as pastors to English-speakers, we are united in our shared faith. Thanks to your commitment, we have never been without the sacraments in English. You have received us into the Church, blessed our marriages, baptized our children, absolved our sins, and united us in the Holy Eucharist which we have received from your hands.</em></p>
<p><em>We ask God’s blessing on you in your service in the vineyard of the Lord, and ask you to rejoice with us on our anniversary – which is also your anniversary – and remember us in your prayers.   </em></p>
<p><em>With gratitude,</em><br/>
<em>The congregation of the Pastoral Centre</em></p>
<p>On the occasion of the anniversary of the Pastoral Centre, and every day, let us pray for our priests:</p>
<p><em>Lord Jesus, walk with Your priests.<br/>
Be so close to them that when they close their eyes in prayer, they see Your eyes looking into theirs with great love.<br/>
In times of discouragement, put an arm around their shoulders and speak to them words of encouragement.<br/>
In times of doubt or weakness, send Your Holy Spirit to give them wisdom and strength.<br/>
In times of temptation or failure, reach down Your hand and place them firmly on their feet.<br/>
Keep them far from all sin, especially mortal sin, most especially before they consecrate the Eucharist.<br/>
When they hold You in their hands, hold them in Your heart, and let them be always assured that You keep them in Your heart.<br/>
When they face You, say, “Well done, good and faithful servant; come into the house of My Father.”<br/>
And for our good and the good of the whole Church, send us more like them.<br/>
Amen.</em></p>
