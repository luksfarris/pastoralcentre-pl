<p>Throughout the liturgical year, the Church celebrates a variety of solemnities, feasts and memorials.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The word “feast” is a general term used to denote festivals that commemorate a teaching or event of religious importance or a particular saint. As the Church celebrates the mystery of Christ throughout the liturgical year, Mary, the Mother of God is especially honored, as are the saints and martyrs, all of whom are recommended to us as examples.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em><strong>Solemnities</strong></em> are the most important feasts of the Church. The celebration of a solemnity begins with the first vespers of the preceding day. Thus several solemnities have their own vigil Mass, which is celebrated in the evening on the day before the solemnity itself. The Nativity of the Lord, for example, has its Vigil Mass – Christmas Eve “Midnight Mass” (in Polish, <em>Wigilia</em>). Other solemnities include the Epiphany, the Ascension, and Pentecost. The celebration of the Solemnities of Easter and Christmas are so important that they continue for eight days.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Some solemnities are Holy Days of Obligation. These vary from country to country.  In Poland, the Holy Days of Obligation are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Mary, the Mother of God (January 1)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Epiphany (January 6)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Corpus Christi (Thursday after Trinity Sunday)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into Heaven (August 15)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">All Saints’ Day (November 1)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Christmas Day (December 25)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">(These feasts of the Church are also public holidays in Poland.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em><strong>Feasts</strong></em> honour a title (e.g., Christ the King) or a mystery of the Lord (e.g., Corpus Christi – the Body and Blood of Christ); or they honour a title or mystery of Our Lady.  Feasts also honour saints of particular importance (for example, Apostles or Evangelists) or historical significance. Feasts are usually celebrated within the limits of the natural day on which they fall; ordinarily they have no vigil Mass.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>Memorials</em></strong> usually honour saints, but may also celebrate some aspect of the Lord Jesus or Our Lady, such as the memorial of the Holy Name of Jesus or the memorial of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Like feasts, memorials are celebrated within one 24-hour day and have no vigil Mass.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In this section of our site, we will chronicle various feasts of the Church, as we follow the liturgical calendar month by month.</span></p>
