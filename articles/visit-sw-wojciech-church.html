<p>The Church of St Wojciech (Adalbert) in Wrocław was first established and consecrated in the 12th century. Dominicans took over the church almost 800 years ago, in 1226. They were led by Czesław Ordrowąż, now Blessed Czesław and a patron of the City of Wrocław. The church has undergone destruction, rebuilding, and expansion over the centuries (including being about 75% destroyed during World War II), making it a fascinating architectural and historical treasure in Wrocław.</p>
<p>The nave of the church (the central axis leading to the altar) is very high and narrow with arches detailed in brickwork – a common feature of ancient churches in this region. Like most traditional Catholic churches, it is build in the shape of a cross, with a transept intersecting the nave.</p>

<p>On the north side of the transept, there is a painting of Our Lady of the Rosary. The painting dates from 1612, and miracles have been attributed to the intercession of the Blessed Virgin for people who have venerated this image and prayed for their needs here. On the south side of the transept, there is a late 17th-century statue of Christ in an attitude of deep thought – also a very common artistic subject in this region.</p>
<p>Most people enter the church not through the main entrance at the west end, but from the south side.  Almost directly opposite this entrance, right across the nave, is the chapel of St Joseph.  In this chapel, during the day, the Blessed Sacrament is exposed for adoration.  Since the church is on a very busy street, many people drop into this chapel to spend some time in prayer and adoration of Christ in the Blessed Sacrament.  This chapel also is where the confessionals are in this church and confession is often available during the day.</p>

<p>Coming in at the same west-side entrance, if you turn immediately to the right, and follow the side aisle, you will come to the chapel of St Czesław.  This chapel is very ornate, in marked contrast to the plain, austere interior of the church proper.</p>
<p>These few pictures should give you a small taste of what is in store for you when you visit the Dominican church of Św Wojciech.  If you’d like to see more, have a look at the parish’s <a href="http://www.wroclaw.dominikanie.pl/panoramy/wejscie.html" target="_blank" title="Panoramic tour of Św Wojciech Church">virtual tour</a>. We will have a private tour and can take our time looking at things (like the intriguing statues of an American Indian and an African native – very likely unique for a Polish church!) and asking questions.</p>
<p>So join us: Sunday, 21 July, at about 14:30.  We’ll discuss more details after Mass on Sunday 14 May.
