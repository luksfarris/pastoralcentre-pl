<p>As you remember, Jesus once said “everyone who sins is a slave to sin” (John 8: 34). The slavery of sin makes us somehow unable to hear what Jesus is saying. Today’s so-called “political correctness” can be described as one of the public secular sins of our times that also made many believers somehow unable to know the Truth,  that is, to know Christ and follow Him.</p>
<p>Political correctness has been described as “a list of doctrines rather unthinkingly regarded as what a thinking person ought to think” (Fr Kevin J. Flannery, <a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/cultr/documents/rc_pc_cultr_01101996_doc_iii-1996-ple_en.html" target="_blank">Promoting Christian Culture in the United States</a>).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=7368" target="_blank">Val J. Peter describes Political Correctness</a> “as being trendy, up-to-date, attuned to the times and worthy of praise…. Political correctness has to do with movements that set a new social standard to be imposed on others by an elite group. What makes it a scourge is that it insists on forced conformity for the sake of conformity” .</p>
<p>I have talked about some of these doctrines recently, when I discussed the homosexual agenda, gender philosophy and relativism.</p>
<p>We recognize politically correct statements when we hear them and we probably recognize them as being contrary to Christian teaching. Why, then, are politically correct ideas contrary to Christian teaching?</p>
<p>The answer lies in their origins with a group of intellectuals in Germany in the early decades of the 1900s. These intellectuals, usually referred to as the Frankfurt School, espoused a Neo-Marxist interpretation of Western culture, which essentially rejected the history, philosophy, politics, social and economic structures, and major institutions – especially the Catholic Church – of Western Civilization.</p>
<p>For these cultural Marxists, all of life was a struggle against the forces of oppression and repression: the oppression of women by men; the oppression of the poor by the rich; the oppression of minorities by majorities – and the repression of our sexual urges based on long-standing moral standards and laws. A key theme in this ideology is the notion that there is no objective truth: no culture, no work of art, no idea, and no human action can ever be considered better or worse than another. This ideology is summed up today by the politically correct slogan, “The only thing I cannot tolerate is intolerance.”</p>
<p>Significantly, this philosophy only existed to destroy Western values and institutions, most of which had been shaped by Christianity. It offered no realistic alternative, no sound basis for building a new society on a model that would be better than Christianity. It is a philosophically, politically and morally sterile and bankrupt ideology. And yet it is the governing ideology of our contemporary culture.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the Frankfurt School had no alternative in mind, nothing with which they hoped to replace a civilization that had been built up over more than two thousand years. Timothy Matthews has cogently outlined <a href="http://forum.prisonplanet.com/index.php?topic=111051.0" target="_blank">the motivation and agenda of the Frankfurt School</a>:<span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"> </span></p>
<p>“Basically, the Frankfurt School believed that as long as an individual had the belief – or even the hope of belief – that his divine gift of reason could solve the problems facing society, then that society would never reach the state of hopelessness and alienation that they considered necessary to provoke socialist revolution. Their task, therefore, was as swiftly as possible to undermine the Judaeo-Christian legacy. To do this they called for the most negative destructive criticism possible of every sphere of life which would be designed to de-stabilize society and bring down what they saw as the ‘oppressive’ order. Their policies, they hoped, would spread like a virus—‘continuing the work of the Western Marxists by other means’ as one of their members noted.</p>
<p>“To further the advance of their ‘quiet’ cultural revolution – but giving us no ideas about their plans for the future – the School recommended (among other things):</p>
<p>1. the creation of racism offences.</p>
<p>2. continual change to create confusion</p>
<p>3. the teaching of sex and homosexuality to children</p>
<p>4. the undermining of schools’ and teachers’ authority</p>
<p>5. huge immigration to destroy identity</p>
<p>6. the promotion of excessive drinking</p>
<p>7. emptying of churches</p>
<p>8. an unreliable legal system with bias against victims of crime</p>
<p>9. dependency on the state or state benefits</p>
<p>10. control and dumbing down of media</p>
<p>11. encouraging the breakdown of the family.</p>
<p>“One of the main ideas of the Frankfurt School was to exploit Freud’s idea of ‘pansexualism’ – the search for pleasure, the exploitation of the differences between the sexes, <a href="http://catholiclane.com/group-marriage-is-next-admits-dutch-father-of-same-sex-marriage/" target="_blank">the overthrowing of traditional relationships between men and women</a>. To further their aims they would:</p>
<p>• attack the authority of the father, deny the specific roles of father and mother, and wrest away from families their rights as primary educators of their children;</p>
<p>• abolish differences in the education of boys and girls;</p>
<p>• abolish all forms of male dominance – hence the presence of women in the armed forces;</p>
<p>• declare women to be an ‘oppressed class’ and men as ‘oppressors’.</p>
<p>“Munzenberg summed up the Frankfurt School’s long-term operation thus: ‘We will make the West so corrupt that it stinks.’</p>
<p>“The School believed there were two types of revolution: (a) political and (b) cultural. Cultural revolution demolishes from within. ‘Modern forms of subjection are marked by mildness’. They saw it as a long-term project and kept their sights clearly focused on the family, education, media, sex and popular culture.”</p>
<p>Anyone with eyes to see and ears to hear must admit that the politically correct ideology promulgated by the Frankfurt School has been a smashing success in many North America and Europe. It is not an exaggeration to say that through the efforts of these intellectuals and their followers, communistic ideology is alive and well and thriving all around us under a different name: Political Correctness.</p>
<p>It is incompatible with our Catholic faith to go along with politically correct ideas, not only because they are wrong and destructive, but because as Christians we have a mission to build a civilization of love firmly grounded in the truth. As <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/1999/june/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19990626_ad-limina-irlanda_en.html" target="_blank">Pope John Paul II reminded the Irish bishops in 1999</a>, “… Christianity teaches the truth – a truth which we ourselves have not devised, but which comes to us as gift.” “Nothing can substitute for the power of the truths of the faith themselves to attract, convince and transform a person’s inner experience.” “Society needs to rediscover the original freshness of the Gospel and to hear again Christ’s message of salvation, truth, hope and joy for the world.” “You are called to proclaim the truth courageously, even if what you teach sometimes goes against socially accepted opinion, in the knowledge that the person and teaching of Jesus Christ are not marginal to the needs of today’s culture, but on the contrary reveal the deepest meaning of all things human.”</p>

<p>In the past couple of weeks, I’ve been talking about marriage and threats to marriage. I’ve talked about what marriage is – a natural coming together of a man and a woman that usually results in children; a sacramental covenant relationship that is exclusive and life-long. I’ve talked about the threat to marriage that has been created by “gender philosophy,” which seeks to redefine the human person without regard for their true sexual nature. Everything I have said may seem obvious to this audience.</p>
<p>What may not be obvious is that what we call “natural” and “normal” in human relationships – marriage, family, bringing up children – may not be called “normal” and “natural” by the time your own children are adults. Let’s look at how quickly western society has changed its view of sexuality, marriage and family.</p>
<p>In 1970, two gay men in the United States attempted to get married and were refused. They took their case to the Supreme Court in their state, but the court ruled that “The institution of marriage as a union of man and woman, uniquely involving the procreation and rearing of children within a family, is as old as the Book of Genesis.” A year later, the men were “married” by a Methodist minister. Forty-three years later, at least twelve countries have legalized “gay marriage” and many more will soon legalize it. Today, the Quakers, Episcopalians, United Church of Christ, and reformed and conservative Jews are among those religious groups that will perform same-sex marriages.</p>
<p>In the late 1980s, lesbian activist Paula Ettelbeck wrote about the gay agenda of “transforming the very fabric of society.” “We must keep our eyes on the goals of providing true alternatives to marriage and of radically reordering society’s view of reality,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Here are some of the ways that society’s view of reality has been radically reordered since then: The word “partner” – which was used in the 1980s to refer only to homosexuals – has replaced “husband” and “wife” in the media and even in school textbooks; in some published articles, you cannot tell at any point whether a couple is two men or two women, a man and a woman, or married or unmarried. In some places that have legalized gay “marriage”, you can no longer get a marriage license with the words “bride” or “groom,” but only “partner 1” and “partner 2” and you will not be pronounced “man and wife” but only “legally married” unless you specifically request to be treated as a man and a woman and referred to as male and female. In effect, the “default mode” for the marriage ceremony is “gender neutral”; in other words, it recognizes homosexuals as typical and heterosexuals as exceptional.</p>
<p>The words “mother” and “father” are seen to exclude “alternative” family constructions, so the word “parent” now is used increasingly because it conveys no sense of being male or female. The United States government was recently under pressure to change children’s passports so that they no longer identified the child’s mother and father, but “parent 1” and “parent 2.” It took great pressure to defeat this attempt at denying the reality that all children have a mother and a father, by nature.</p>
<p>In some places, the Church has had to shut down adoption agencies because they refuse to place children with homosexual couples. The children lose a chance at a normal home, and normal parents have less chance of adopting children. In places where the homosexual agenda has gained legal status, people are sued for refusing services that imply acceptance of gay marriage – such as printing wedding invitations or allowing gay couples to rent a hall for a “wedding reception” or for refusing to rent a room to a gay couple – and are put in jail or fined for preaching against homosexual acts. More and more frequently we hear about people who have lost their jobs (for example as marriage counsellors or civil servants who perform wedding ceremonies) because they refused to comply with laws that favour so-called “equal rights” for gays or “marriage for all.” All of this has happened in less than one lifetime, and we can expect more of the same in the future.</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, there has been a growing effort to radically “reorder society’s view of reality.” It may look as though this distorted view of humanity will win. But we must remember and we must not be afraid to preach the truth – the reality – about our human nature:</p>
<p>“Man and woman have been created, which is to say, willed by God: on the one hand, in perfect equality as human persons; on the other, in their respective beings as man and woman. ‘Being man’ or ‘being woman’ is a reality which is good and willed by God…. In their ‘being-man’ and ‘being-woman,’ they reflect the Creator’s wisdom and goodness” (<em>CCC</em> 369).</p>
<p>“God created man and woman together and willed each for the other…” (<em>CCC</em> 371).</p>
<p>“Man and woman were made ‘for each other’ …God… created them to be a communion of persons, in which each can be ‘helpmate’ to the other, for they are equal as persons…and complementary as masculine and feminine. In marriage God unites them in such a way that, by forming “one flesh,” they can transmit human life…. By transmitting human life to their descendants, man and woman as spouses and parents cooperate in a unique way in the Creator’s work” (<em>CCC</em> 372).</p>

<p>Last week I talked to you about how the Church defines marriage as a sacramental union between a man and a woman, ordered to the unity of the man and woman, and toward the procreation of children. In that discussion, it was necessary to talk about the complementary nature of men and women as sexual beings, since in nature, only two people with complementary sexual organs can possibly reproduce. Today I would like to talk to you about a threat to natural and sacramental marriage. To do so, it is necessary first to define some terms.</p>
<p>In 2011, a special European Union council created a legal document aimed at ending violence against women. It is the first EU document that attempts to define “gender.”</p>
<p>The use of the word “gender” creates a problem when talking about women and men. Historically, “gender” is a grammatical term. English-speakers who are studying Polish have encountered this strange aspect of our grammar. Why should a “cocoon” be masculine and a “spoon” be feminine, when neither one has any sexual characteristics? It is because “gender” properly only refers to grammatical categories; it has nothing to do with sexual characteristics. When a child is born and we say “it is a boy” or “it is a girl,” to the child’s sex – not gender. Sex is a biological fact that can be affirmed through DNA testing. The word “gender” is used to avoid having to look at reality: that human beings are born male and female.</p>
<p>In 2004, then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger outlined how “gender philosophy” came into existence, and the implications it has for men, women and Christian revelation:</p>
<p>“2. <em>Recent years have seen new approaches to women’s issues. A first tendency is to emphasize strongly conditions of subordination in order to give rise to antagonism: women, in order to be themselves, must make themselves the adversaries of men. Faced with the abuse of power, the answer for women is to seek power. This process leads to opposition between men and women, in which the identity and role of one are emphasized to the disadvantage of the other, leading to harmful confusion regarding the human person, which has its most immediate and lethal effects in the structure of the family</em>.</p>
<p>“<em>A second tendency emerges in the wake of the first. In order to avoid the domination of one sex or the other, their differences tend to be denied, viewed as mere effects of historical and cultural conditioning. In this perspective, physical difference, termed sex, is minimized, while the purely cultural element, termed gender, is emphasized to the maximum and held to be primary. The obscuring of the difference or duality of the sexes has enormous consequences on a variety of levels. This theory of the human person, intended to promote prospects for equality of women through liberation from biological determinism, has in reality inspired ideologies which, for example, call into question the family, in its natural two-parent structure of mother and father, and make homosexuality and heterosexuality virtually equivalent, in a new model of polymorphous sexuality</em>.</p>
<p>“3. <em>While the immediate roots of this second tendency are found in the context of reflection on women’s roles, its deeper motivation must be sought in the human attempt to be freed from one’s biological conditioning.2 According to this perspective, human nature in itself does not possess characteristics in an absolute manner: all persons can and ought to constitute themselves as they like, since they are free from every predetermination linked to their essential constitution</em>.</p>
<p>“<em>This perspective has many consequences. Above all it strengthens the idea that the liberation of women entails criticism of Sacred Scripture, which would be seen as handing on a patriarchal conception of God nourished by an essentially male-dominated culture. Second, this tendency would consider as lacking in importance and relevance the fact that the Son of God assumed human nature in its male form</em>.” (Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, <a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20040731_collaboration_en.html" target="_blank">Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Collaboration of Men and Women in the Church and in the World</a>, 31 May 2004)</p>
<p>The European Convention’s definition of “gender” is this: gender is “the socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for women and men” (<a href="http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/treaties/html/210.htm" target="_blank">Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence</a> against Women and Domestic Violence, article 3, section c).</p>
<p>Notice: we are not men and women because of our observable sexual organs or our DNA. Our identity as male and female are merely “socially constructed roles” or “behaviours, activities and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women.” If the roles of men and women are only “socially constructed,” and not rooted in our biology and nature, then surely society can reconstruct those roles: a man can be a mother; a woman can have testosterone injections, change her name, and be legally declared to be a man. We have already seen this happening. If the “roles, behaviours, activities and attributes” of men and women are merely what a “given society considers appropriate,” then any society can be re-educated to think that other “roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes” are appropriate for men and women. In European schools, children are now being re-educated to believe that men can be mothers and women can be fathers.</p>
<p>“Gender politics” has at its core a radical rejection of our human nature in favour of a radical self-assertion: we no longer have to accept a nature that is given to us and shapes. we can choose our nature, we can change our nature whenever we please.</p>
<p>“<em>The Chief Rabbi of France, Gilles Bernheim, has shown in a very detailed and profoundly moving study that the attack we are currently experiencing on the true structure of the family, made up of father, mother, and child, goes much deeper. While up to now we regarded a false understanding of the nature of human freedom as one cause of the crisis of the family, it is now becoming clear that the very notion of being – of what being human really means – is being called into question. He quotes the famous saying of Simone de Beauvoir: “one is not born a woman, one becomes so</em>” (on ne naît pas femme, on le devient). <em>These words lay the foundation for what is put forward today under the term “gender” as a new philosophy of sexuality. According to this philosophy, sex is no longer a given element of nature, that man has to accept and personally make sense of: it is a social role that we choose for ourselves, while in the past it was chosen for us by society. The profound falsehood of this theory and of the anthropological revolution contained within it is obvious. People dispute the idea that they have a nature, given by their bodily identity, that serves as a defining element of the human being. They deny their nature and decide that it is not something previously given to them, but that they make it for themselves. According to the biblical creation account, being created by God as male and female pertains to the essence of the human creature. This duality is an essential aspect of what being human is all about, as ordained by God. This very duality as something previously given is what is now disputed. The words of the creation account: “male and female he created them” (<a class="verseLink 1_1_27_0_0_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=genesis+1:27" target="_blank">Gen 1:27</a>) no longer apply. No, what applies now is this: it was not God who created them male and female – hitherto society did this, now we decide for ourselves. Man and woman as created realities, as the nature of the human being, no longer exist. Man calls his nature into question. From now on he is merely spirit and will. The manipulation of nature, which we deplore today where our environment is concerned, now becomes man’s fundamental choice where he himself is concerned. From now on there is only the abstract human being, who chooses for himself what his nature is to be. Man and woman in their created state as complementary versions of what it means to be human are disputed. But if there is no pre-ordained duality of man and woman in creation, then neither is the family any longer a reality established by creation. Likewise, the child has lost the place he had occupied hitherto and the dignity pertaining to him. Bernheim shows that now, perforce, from being a subject of rights, the child has become an object to which people have a right and which they have a right to obtain. When the freedom to be creative becomes the freedom to create oneself, then necessarily the Maker himself is denied and ultimately man too is stripped of his dignity as a creature of God, as the image of God at the core of his being. The defence of the family is about man himself. And it becomes clear that when God is denied, human dignity also disappears. Whoever defends God is defending man.”</em> (<a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2012/december/documents/hf_ben-xvi_spe_20121221_auguri-curia_en.html" target="_blank">Address of His Holiness Benedict XVI on the Occasion of Christmas Greetings to the Roman Curia</a>, Clementine Hall, Friday, 21 December 2012)</p>

<p>Last time I explained Catholic teaching on homosexuality, which has become a political issue having profound effects on society. Yesterday, for example, the French parliament voted to redefine marriage as between two <em>persons</em> instead of a man and a woman, which is the opposite of the recent Polish rejection of legal status for homosexual partnerships.</p>
<p>The very idea of calling a homosexual relationship the same as “marriage” could not have arisen without a steady decline in our understanding of what marriage really is.</p>
<p>Throughout history, marriage has been understood as a natural state: the coming together of two complementary persons – a man and a woman – with the usual result of children. Since it takes many years for children to mature, marriage is by nature a long-term relationship. The Bible affirms this reality in the creation of Adam and Eve: a man and woman were created as one couple, and the first thing they were told to do was to come together and beget children. When Jesus was asked about divorce, he said that it was “not that way in the beginning” (<a class="verseLink 41_19_8_0_0_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=matthew+19:8" target="_blank">Mt 19:8</a>). God’s original plan for marriage was a lifelong union of a man and a woman, ordered to the unity of the spouses and the begetting of children.</p>
<p>Saint Paul also condemned divorce (<a class="verseLink 47_7_10_0_11_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=1+corinthians+7:10-11" target="_blank">1 Cor 7:10-11</a>; <a class="verseLink 46_7_2_0_3_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=romans+7:2-3" target="_blank">Rom 7:2-3</a>), and compared the relationship between a husband and wife to the mystery of Christ’s relationship to the Church: the Church is the very Body of Christ, and there is no separation; the union of husband and wife is the same: the two become one flesh (cf. <a class="verseLink 50_5_25_0_33_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=ephesians+5:25-33" target="_blank">Eph 5:25-33</a>). One theologian likes to say that in marriage, when the two become one flesh, that unity is so real that nine months later you have to give it a name.</p>
<p>The unity of the husband and wife, and their resulting child, is an image of the Holy Trinity, written into our natures. It should not be a surprise that when God became flesh, He did so in the context of a family, because God is a Trinity of Persons in relationship. Human beings were created to live out this relationality in marriage and family.</p>
<p>The Church teaches that marriage is a covenant, not a contract. In a contract, there is an agreement to exchange goods or services: if one party does not keep his side of the agreement, the contract can be dissolved by legal means. A covenant, on the other hand, is an exchange of persons. In marriage, the husband and wife “give themselves definitively and totally to one another…. The covenant they freely [enter into] imposes on the spouses the obligation to preserve it as unique and indissoluble” (<em>CCC</em> 2364). In short, the complete self-giving of the marriage covenant makes divorce impossible. Two who are one flesh cannot be separated by any human power – including government power: “What therefore <em>God</em> has joined together, let not <em>man</em> put asunder” (<a class="verseLink 42_10_9_0_0_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=mark+10:9" target="_blank">Mk 10:9</a>, emphasis added).</p>
<p>From these brief remarks about the nature of marriage, we can see what marriage is <em>not</em>.</p>
<p>Marriage is not a temporary partnership that can be dissolved at any time – after one night or ten years. For this reason it is impossible to have a “trial marriage”, because marriage is defined by total self-giving and unconditional love for the spouse.  “Living together” is not the same as an exclusive, unbreakable life-long commitment to another person.  It is by definition <em>conditional</em> love: trying the other person out to decide whether the person is worthy of an exclusive, unbreakable, life-long commitment.  Such a parody of love is unworthy of the dignity of the human person.  Moreover, practicing conditional “love” is not a sound basis for a true marriage commitment of <em>un</em>conditional love.  Further, most couples who live together practice contraception: they have not made a permanent commitment to one another, and certainly are not committed to the life-long bond of having a child together.  Thus in such relationships there is not <em>total</em> self-giving, since the participants withhold from one another the full gift of their fertility and arm themselves with various means to “protect” themselves from the threat of the other person’s fertility.</p>
<p>Total self-giving is expressed in the marriage act between a man and a woman, which, following the course of nature, normally has children “as its fruit and fulfillment”. Marriage, therefore, is “on the side of life” so that “each and every marriage act” is “ordered <em>per se</em> to the procreation of human life” (<em>CCC</em> 2366). For this reason, a couple who are <em>willfully</em> closed to the possibility of children when they exchange their vows, are not validly married.* And a relationship that lacks the biological complementarity necessary for procreation – such as a homosexual relationship – cannot be called a marriage.</p>
<p>* Men and women who are infertile naturally, through illness or through accident, can be validly married because there is no intention to reject God’s gift of children or to “protect” themselves from complete self-giving to their spouses. As a man and a woman, their marital relations are <em>naturally ordered</em> to procreation, even if an unavoidable or incurable medical condition renders them infertile.</p>

<p>Last week I talked about moral relativism – the idea that there is no objective moral standard for human behavior. The tendency to moral relativism has been called a “dictatorship of relativism” because moral relativism is now the moving force in shaping public opinion and laws in the West.  Pope Benedict has spoken about this on a number of occasions, summarizing the problem in <a href="http://romancatholicblog.typepad.com/roman_catholic_blog/2005/04/thanks_to_willi.html" target="_blank">a homily early in his pontificate</a>: “<em>relativism, which is letting oneself be tossed and ‘swept along by every wind of teaching’, looks like the only attitude [acceptable] to today’s standards. We are moving towards a dictatorship of relativism which does not recognize anything as for certain and which has as its highest goal one’s own ego and one’s own desires.”</em></p>
<p>In this context, the Church, which speaks for the unchanging law of God and the true nature of the human person, is often silenced or excluded from public discussion. One area in which the voice of the Church is ignored or distorted by the media is the issue of homosexuality. In today’s catechesis, I will outline very briefly the Church’s teaching about homosexual persons and homosexual acts.</p>
<p>First, the Church teaches that “the human person, made in the image and likeness of God” cannot be described only by “reference to his or her sexual orientation” (<a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html" target="_blank">Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons</a>, 16; hereafter abbreviated PCHP). This means that the Church is concerned with the whole person, not merely the person’s sexual orientation.  The Church believes and teaches</p>
<p>“<em>that a homosexual person, as every human being, deeply needs to be nourished at many different levels simultaneously.</em></p>
<p><em>“The human person, made in the image and likeness of God, can hardly be adequately described by a reductionist reference to his or her sexual orientation. Every one living on the face of the earth has personal problems and difficulties, but challenges to growth, strengths, talents and gifts as well. Today, the Church provides a badly needed context for the care of the human person when she refuses to consider the person as a ‘heterosexual’ or a ‘homosexual’ and insists that every person has a fundamental Identity: the creature of God, and by grace, his child and heir to eternal life</em>” (<a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html" target="_blank">PCHP</a>, 16).</p>
<p>When the Church rejects false ideas about homosexuality, the Church “does not limit but rather defends personal freedom and diginity”:</p>
<p>“<em>To chose someone of the same sex for one’s sexual activity is to annul the rich symbolism and meaning, not to mention the goals, of the Creator’s sexual design. Homosexual activity is not a complementary union, able to transmit life; and so it thwarts the call to a life of that form of self-giving which the Gospel says is the essence of Christian living. This does not mean that homosexual persons are not often generous and giving of themselves; but when they engage in homosexual activity they confirm within themselves a disordered sexual inclination which is essentially self-indulgent.</em></p>
<p><em>“As in every moral disorder, homosexual activity prevents one’s own fulfillment and happiness by acting contrary to the creative wisdom of God. The Church, in rejecting erroneous opinions regarding homosexuality, does not limit but rather defends personal freedom and dignity realistically and authentically understood</em>” (<a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html" target="_blank">PCHP</a>, 7).</p>
<p>Further, the Church condemns “violent malice in speech or action” against homosexuals:</p>
<p>“<em>It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action. Such treatment deserves condemnation from the Church’s pastors wherever it occurs. It reveals a kind of disregard for others which endangers the most fundamental principles of a healthy society. The intrinsic dignity of each person must always be respected in word, in action and in law”</em> (<a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html" target="_blank">PCHP</a>, 10).</p>
<p>At the same time, although having a homosexual orientation “is not a sin, it is a more or less strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil, and thus the inclination itself must be seen as an objective disorder” (<a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html" target="_blank">PCHP</a>, 3).</p>
<p>The Church bases her understanding of homosexual acts as “disordered” on the testimony of Scripture:</p>
<p>“<em>Providing a basic plan for understanding this entire discussion of homosexuality is the theology of creation we find in Genesis. God, in his infinite wisdom and love, brings into existence all of reality as a reflection of his goodness. He fashions mankind, male and female, in his own image and likeness. Human beings, therefore, are nothing less than the work of God himself; and in the complementarity of the sexes, they are called to reflect the inner unity of the Creator. They do this in a striking way in their cooperation with him in the transmission of life by a mutual donation of the self to the other</em>.</p>
<p>“<em>In Genesis 3, we find that this truth about persons being an image of God has been obscured by original sin. There inevitably follows a loss of awareness of the covenantal character of the union these persons had with God and with each other. The human body retains its “spousal significance” but this is now clouded by sin. Thus, in <a class="verseLink 1_19_1_0_11_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=genesis+19:1-11" target="_blank">Genesis 19:1-11</a>, the deterioration due to sin continues in the story of the men of Sodom. There can be no doubt of the moral judgement made there against homosexual relations. In <a class="verseLink 3_18_22_0_0_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=leviticus+18:22" target="_blank">Leviticus 18:22</a> and 20:13, in the course of describing the conditions necessary for belonging to the Chosen People, the author excludes from the People of God those who behave in a homosexual fashion</em>.</p>
<p>“<em>Against the background of this exposition of theocratic law, an eschatological perspective is developed by St. Paul when, in <a class="verseLink 47_6_9_0_0_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=1+corinthians+6:9" target="_blank">I Cor 6:9</a>, he proposes the same doctrine and lists those who behave in a homosexual fashion among those who shall not enter the Kingdom of God</em>.</p>
<p>“<em>In <a class="verseLink 46_1_18_0_32_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=romans+1:18-32" target="_blank">Romans 1:18-32</a>, still building on the moral traditions of his forebears, but in the new context of the confrontation between Christianity and the pagan society of his day, Paul uses homosexual behaviour as an example of the blindness which has overcome humankind. Instead of the original harmony between Creator and creatures, the acute distortion of idolatry has led to all kinds of moral excess. Paul is at a loss to find a clearer example of this disharmony than homosexual relations. Finally, 1 Tim. 1, in full continuity with the Biblical position, singles out those who spread wrong doctrine and in v. 10 explicitly names as sinners those who engage in homosexual acts</em>” (<a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html" target="_blank">PCHP</a>, 6).</p>
<p>When it comes to human sexuality, the Church “<em>celebrates the divine plan of the loving and life-giving union of men and women in the sacrament of marriage [and teaches that] it is only in the marital relationship that the use of the sexual faculty can be morally good. A person engaging in homosexual behavior therefore acts immorally</em>” (<a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html" target="_blank">PCHP</a>, 7).</p>
<p>The Church rejects the idea that “the sexual nature of homosexual persons is always and totally compulsive,” or that homosexuals are “born that way” and therefore they cannot resist committing homosexual acts. This notion is demeaning to the the dignity of a human person, endowed with reason and free will, capable of making moral choices:</p>
<p>“<em>It has been argued that the homosexual orientation in certain cases is not the result of deliberate choice; and so the homosexual person would then have no choice but to behave in a homosexual fashion. Lacking freedom, such a person, even if engaged in homosexual activity, would not be culpable.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Here, the Church’s wise moral tradition is necessary since it warns against generalizations in judging individual cases. In fact, circumstances may exist, or may have existed in the past, which would reduce or remove the culpability of the individual in a given instance; or other circumstances may increase it. What is at all costs to be avoided is the unfounded and demeaning assumption that the sexual behaviour of homosexual persons is always and totally compulsive and therefore inculpable. What is essential is that the fundamental liberty which characterizes the human person and gives him his dignity be recognized as belonging to the homosexual person as well</em>” (<a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html" target="_blank">PCHP</a>, 11).</p>
<p>At the same time, the Church recognizes that “the abandonment of homosexual activity will require a profound collaboration of the individual with God’s liberating grace” (<a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html" target="_blank">PCHP</a>, 11).</p>
<p>How can a homosexual person cope with his condition and follow the Lord? Essentially, homosexuals are called to do the same as every one of us who is tempted by sin. We are “called to enact the will of God in [our lives] by joining whatever sufferings and difficulties [we] experience…to the sacrifice of the Lord’s Cross.”</p>
<p>“<em>Christians who are homosexual are called, as all of us are, to a chaste life. As they dedicate their lives to understanding the nature of God’s personal call to them, they will be able to celebrate the Sacrament of Penance more faithfully and receive the Lord’s grace so freely offered there in order to convert their lives more fully to his Way</em>” (<a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html">PCHP</a>, 12)</p>
<p>Saint Paul taught all of his flock that</p>
<p>“<em>the Spirit produces in the lives of the faithful “love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, trustfulness, gentleness and self-control” (<a class="verseLink 49_5_22_0_0_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=galatians+5:22" target="_blank">Gal 5:22</a>) and further (<a class="verseLink 49_5_24_0_0_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=galatians+5:24" target="_blank">Gal 5:24</a>), “You cannot belong to Christ unless you crucify all self-indulgent passions and desires</em>.”</p>
<p>“<em>It is easily misunderstood, however, if it is merely seen as a pointless effort at self-denial. The Cross is a denial of self, but in service to the will of God himself who makes life come from death and empowers those who trust in him to practise virtue in place of vice</em>” (<a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html" target="_blank">PHCP</a>, 12).</p>
<p>The Church recognizes that struggling with homosexual orientation and impulses is a great cross, and insists that homosexuals must be treated with dignity:</p>
<p>“<em>The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God’s will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord’s Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition”</em> (<a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm" target="_blank"><em>CCC</em></a> 2358)</p>
<p>At the same time, we must not condone or accept homosexual acts as good, natural or morally neutral:</p>
<p>“<em>There is an effort in some countries to manipulate the Church by gaining the often well-intentioned support of her pastors with a view to changing civil-statutes and laws. This is done in order to conform to these pressure groups’ concept that homosexuality is at least a completely harmless, if not an entirely good, thing. Even when the practice of homosexuality may seriously threaten the lives and well-being of a large number of people, its advocates remain undeterred and refuse to consider the magnitude of the risks involved</em>.</p>
<p>“<em>The Church can never be so callous. It is true that her clear position cannot be revised by pressure from civil legislation or the trend of the moment. But she is really concerned about the many who are not represented by the pro-homosexual movement and about those who may have been tempted to believe its deceitful propaganda. She is also aware that the view that homosexual activity is equivalent to, or as acceptable as, the sexual expression of conjugal love has a direct impact on society’s understanding of the nature and rights of the family and puts them in jeopardy</em>” (<a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19861001_homosexual-persons_en.html" target="_blank">PCHP</a>, 9).</p>

</p><div class="collapseomatic_content" id="target-id2842">
<p>In the past couple of weeks, I’ve been talking to you about doubts that can cause us difficulty in our Christian faith. Today I’d like to talk to you about the doubts that can arise through an attitude of moral relativism.</p>
<p>Simply put, moral relativism is the idea that there is no such thing as objective truth about what is right and what is wrong. In practice, a society that has fallen into moral relativism acts as though each person is free to decide what is true for him or her alone; each person can decide what is acceptable and unacceptable, for him or her alone. Anyone who tries to say that there is one truth about morally good and evil acts becomes an enemy of “freedom”. We can see this around us today in the immoral practices that have become socially acceptable and legal in the name of freedom:</p>
<p>— Homosexuals have claimed that their perverse sexual acts are good. In eleven countries they have succeeded in having their perversity declared to be the same thing as natural marriage between a man and a woman. The next step is to demand the right to adopt and bring up a new generation of children whose only example of family life is a homosexual lifestyle.</p>
<p>— At the end of the Second World War, the world was horrified at revelations of genocide – people being murdered because of being considered “inconvenient” or “unfit” to live. We now have a society in which the weakest and most vulnerable – the unborn – are killed in the womb. This has led in turn to legalization of the killing of other vulnerable people – the ill, the handicapped and the elderly – through euthanasia.</p>
<p>Our morals have eroded so quickly and so completely that we can understand why, shortly before his death, the moral philosopher Dietrich von Hildebrand told his wife, “<a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/column.php?n=2395" target="_blank">Hitler won the war</a>.”</p>
<p>Strangely, moral relativists usually accuse priests, especially, of the same sins that they wish to convince us are good things – homosexuality and the corruption of children. Moral relativists who claim the freedom and right to kill themselves and their children, accuse the Church of being responsible for thousands of deaths from AIDS, because the Church teaches that using condoms is a sin. Such is the perversity of people who have lost contact with morality and truth.</p>
<p>The influences of moral relativism are all around us in our media: Christians are openly attacked, and the Church is depicted as evil, because the Church insists that all life is sacred, and that the only “safe sex” is between a man and woman, who are faithful to each other in marriage.</p>
<p>Many, many Catholics today are full of doubts about the Church because of the messages of moral relativism in our media: they doubt God’s mercy, because they have been taught it is “merciful” to kill anyone who is suffering or who might suffer. They doubt that God is loving, because they have been told that the Church “hates” homosexuals. They doubt that they can trust their priests and bishops, because the media only reports scandals about the Church, but not its good works or true teaching.</p>
<p>The consistent message of moral relativism in our culture is a threat to the faith of many individuals. It is also a threat to our freedom as individuals and as Catholics.</p>
<p>You have probably heard about half a million people – Catholics, non-Catholic Christians, Jews and non-religious people – who recently marched together in protest against same-sex marriage and homosexual adoption of children in France. In response, the French president has simply declared that he will ignore the will of the people and impose “marriage for all” on the country.</p>
<p>Less than four months ago, in October 2012, the European Parliamentary Forum on Population and Development compiled a list of 27 pro-life personalities in Europe – only they called them “anti-choice.” These are people who believe that it is wrong to take innocent human life. But that belief is contrary to European policy, and so they now find themselves on a government list of enemies of the official policy of the European Union.</p>
<p>Blessed Pope John Paul II wrote that “the risk of an alliance between democracy and ethical relativism” is that it removes “any sure moral reference point from political and social life…” making ‘the acknowledgement of truth impossible’ (<em><a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/encyclicals/documents/hf_jp-ii_enc_06081993_veritatis-splendor_en.html" target="_blank">Veritatis Splendor</a>,</em> 101). We can see this happening all around us today.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church, however, provides a “sure moral reference point” that is systematically being attacked and silenced in political and social life.</p>

</p><div class="collapseomatic_content" id="target-id8681">
<p>Last week I talked about voluntary doubts, and how we are making a choice to doubt God when we consult horoscopes, astrology, palm-readers, fortune-tellers and the like. The reason why we classify these things as voluntarily doubting God is because they imply that God is not in control of the universe, but that something God created – for example, the stars – can control our destiny.</p>
<p>Another problem with these superstitious practices is that they imply that we have no personal control over our future; that we do not, should not or cannot make choices for good or for evil, choices that will have good or bad results. Simply, when we believe that some hidden powers in the universe are in control of our destiny, we deny our own free will. We abandon responsibility for our own lives.</p>
<p>Another way that people voluntarily doubt God is when they attribute to the devil a greater power than he actually has. Some people have the mistaken idea that the universe is divided between two primordial powers: God, who is good; and the devil, who is bad. This view is absolutely contrary to God’s revelation and the teaching of the Church. The devil is a creature, an angel. He was created completely good. He was fully equipped with intelligence and will. The devil freely chose to rebel against God, against goodness. Because he is an angel, he is still very powerful and far more intelligent than human beings. However, he is always a creature. He only continues to exist or to act because God allows him to exist and to act. He can attack us or tempt us, but if we trust in God and obey God’s commandments, the devil cannot overcome us.</p>
<p>We can keep the devil far from us by frequenting the sacraments – especially the Eucharist and confession – and by not inviting him into our lives through occult practices like trying to contact the dead, using a ouija board, or using a medium to channel spirits.</p>
<p>If we say that the devil ‘makes us’ do something, we deny our free will. Free will is fundamental to our nature: we are not slaves of the devil and we are not slaves of God. We can succumb to the temptation of the devil, or we can accept the invitation of God. We are free to choose good or evil, and we must choose between them. The <em>Catechism</em> teaches that “Freedom is the power, rooted in reason and will, to act or not to act, to do this or that, and so to perform deliberate actions on one’s own responsibility” (<em>CCC</em> 1731).</p>
<p>This responsibility to choose extends to our activity in the wider world. When God created man, he placed him in the garden “to till it and keep it.” That is still our responsibility in the world. As Pope Benedict has taught, “Everything that exists belongs to God, who has entrusted it to man, albeit not for his arbitrary use…. Man thus has a duty to exercise responsible stewardship over creation, to care for it and to cultivate it” (Pope Benedict XVI, Message for the World Day of Peace, 1 January 2012).</p>
<p>It is against our human nature to abandon responsibility for our lives by behaving as though the stars, the devil, or other powers are in control of our actions or our destiny. In fact, it is through the proper exercise of our free will that we eventually find our destiny, which is eternal happiness with God. “By free will one shapes one’s own life. Human freedom is a force for growth and maturity in truth and goodness; it attains its perfection when directed toward God, our beatitude” (<em>CCC</em> 1731). When we know that our destiny is heaven, we have no reason to fear the future or to try to predict it. A “sound Christian attitude consists in putting oneself confidently into the hands of Providence for whatever concerns the future, and giving up all unhealthy curiosity about it” (<em>CCC</em> 2115).</p>

</p><div class="collapseomatic_content" id="target-id8116">
<p>In the last couple of weeks, I’ve been talking about doubts we can have in our faith.  The Church recognizes that “revealed truths can seem obscure to human reason and experience…” But we must remember that faith “is more certain than all human knowledge because [faith] is founded on the very word of God, who cannot lie.”  Because we are talking about faith in God, who cannot lie, we often say that “Ten thousand difficulties” in matters of faith “do not [equal] one doubt” in God’s revealed truth (see <em>CCC</em> 157).</p>
<p>Experiencing doubts and difficulties is a normal part of our everyday life.  We have difficulties in our jobs, our studies, our relationships.  To have a happy, successful life, we have to overcome our doubts and difficulties.</p>
<p>It’s similar in our spiritual lives.  The English writer G.K. Chesterton said that, “The Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting. It has been found difficult and left untried.” The Christian ideal is difficult.  But if we tell ourselves that “difficult” means “impossible” we are deliberately cultivating our doubts, and we will end in spiritual blindness (cf. <em>CCC</em> 2088).</p>
<p>Today I want to talk about the problem of voluntary and involuntary doubts. Very simply, involuntary doubt refers to hesitation in believing; difficulty overcoming objections to the faith; or anxiety because something is unclear to you.  These doubts are usually easy to overcome, because the person wants to believe, but is only having a difficulty.</p>
<p>Voluntary doubt is different.  Voluntary doubt means that a person disregards or refuses to accept the truth of something revealed by God or something taught by the Church (<em>CCC</em> 2088).  It may be a hard to imagine someone deliberately refusing to accept the truth revealed by God.  But there is one common way that many people today – even so-called faithful Catholics – practice voluntary doubt.  The simple names for it are superstition and sorcery.</p>
<p>Things like “horoscopes, astrology, palm reading” and going to a medium to have your fortune told are a voluntary rejection of God’s revelation.  They “conceal a desire for power over time, history,…and other human beings….” Sometimes these practices involve a wish to conciliate some ‘hidden powers’ such as Satan or demons.  When we place our trust in some other power than the power of God, we “contradict the honor, respect and loving fear that we owe to God alone” (<em>CCC</em> 2116).</p>
<p>Today’s liturgy is connected with the Three Kings, also called Magi – magicians or astrologers. It is significant that when these Magi followed their astrological calculations, they reached Divine Revelation Himself in the stable in Bethlehem, and they bowed down and adored him.  We do not call them the “Three Wise Men” because of their occult powers or astrological knowledge.  They are the “Wise Men” because they realized that their occult powers and [astrological calculations were nothing in comparison to Divine Revelation.     <em></em></p>
<p>Before God was fully revealed in the nativity of Christ, it was perhaps natural for people to turn to sorcery and magic to try to have some kind of control over the supernatural.  But all such practices are now condemned in the light of God’s revelation.  Some of the condemned practices include:</p>
<ul>
<li>trying to harm someone through magic spells</li>
<li>trying to control demons or spirits</li>
<li>wearing ‘good-luck charms’</li>
<li>using traditional cures that involve calling on demons or channeling spirits (cf. <em>CCC</em> 2117).</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever we get involved in such things we are doubting that God alone rules the universe and God alone is Lord of our lives. This is voluntary doubt.</p>
<p>The simplest way to insure that you will not fall into voluntary doubt is to follow the advice of Saint Paul:  “Whatever you do in word or work, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God the Father through Him” (<a class="verseLink 52_3_17_0_0_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=colossians+3:17" target="_blank">Col. 3:17</a>).</p>

</p><div class="collapseomatic_content" id="target-id1813">
<p>In previous catecheses I’ve mentioned that faith is a free personal act, but at the same time, we come to faith through the community of believers who make up the Church. I’ve also explained that faith is not just believing, but the content of what we believe. Further, we’ve explored how faith and reason are complementary, and not in contradiction to one another. Last week, I discussed the mystery of God, which can sometimes lead to doubts in the hearts and minds of the faithful.</p>
<p>Today I want to focus more on the problem of doubts that assail our faith, and how we are to deal with doubts. The Second Vatican Council looked at the issue of faith in the modern world. The Church realizes that new conditions that exist in the world have an impact on religion and people’s way of thinking about religion. In modern times, people are more able to make a distinction between true religion and a magical or superstitious view of the world. We are able to distinguish more clearly the difference between something like wishing on a star and praying for a miracle; we know that one is pure fancy and the other is standing as a creature before a good and loving Creator, communicating our needs in trust and hope. Because we are more aware in this way, “many persons are achieving a more vivid sense of God.” However, as <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html" target="_blank" title="Gaudium et spes"><em>Gaudium et Spes</em></a> pointed out, “growing numbers of people are abandoning religion in practice” (<em>GS</em> 7).</p>
<p>When we are children, it is easy and natural for us to have faith, because as children, we easily believe what we are taught by our parents and other authorities. As we grow older and increase in knowledge of the world, we have more questions, and if we ask them, and are persistent in seeking answers, we find that there are clear answers to our questions about the faith, answers that will satisfy our intellects and speak to our hearts. But very often, as we grow into adulthood, our days are taken up with learning so much about the world that our knowledge of the faith becomes stagnant. We know more about business, politics, science, world events, the economy, and how to do our jobs. But our knowledge and understanding of the faith ceases to keep pace with our knowledge and understanding of the world. Our doubts about the faith may really be based in ignorance of the faith, and not in things that are somehow wrong with what we believe as Catholics. This means that to avoid doubts, we need to read the Bible, read books and articles about our faith, read encyclicals, homilies and messages written by the popes, listen to informative programs that help us grow in faith, or watch TV shows that explain aspects of our faith. You can find many, many links to all of these things on the <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/links/" target="_blank" title="Links and additional resources">links section</a> of our Pastoral Centre website. If you explore it, you will surely find at least one resource that interests you.</p>
<p>Even Catholics who have an adult understanding of their faith will still have times of doubt, perhaps not so much about what we believe, but about problems of good and evil, about their own ability to live by God’s commandments and God’s ability to support them by grace and forgive them for their sins. This kind of doubt is best addressed with an active prayer life: daily prayer, especially in the morning; examination of conscience at night. Regular use of the sacrament of confession, receiving the Eucharist, praying the rosary, going on pilgrimages – all of these things strengthen our relationship with God and help us depend on him in times of doubt or uncertainty.</p>
<p>In all of these things, it is important to remember that we believe in and through and with the Church – this means other believers. To have strong faith, it is always helpful to build strong bonds with people who are also believers: people who are comfortable sharing their faith, whether it is explaining doctrines of the Church or sharing the struggles and joys of their own faith journey. It is vital to our faith life to have friends who will pray for us and with us. We should be able to talk to our friends and families about everything that is important to us – not just our work or problems; not just current events and hobbies – but our relationship to God. Also, as part of a community of believers, we are called to build up one another in faith. So we should be ready to help others grow in faith, as well as being able to accept correction from other believers when we are not living up to the teachings of the Church.</p>
<p>Whatever our doubts may be, there is a starting-place for every doubt, and that is in our own minds or hearts. So when we have doubts about our faith, we need to examine the state of our faith. Doubts about the faith will not become a serious stumbling-block if we are studying our faith; maintaining a regular prayer life; and openly sharing faith in our relationships with family, friends, colleagues and neighbors.</p>

</p><div class="collapseomatic_content" id="target-id298">
<p>Last week I talked about the relationship between faith, reason and knowledge. As Pope Pius IX pointed out, faith is above reason, but there is no real disagreement between them, because both faith and reason come from God, who is the eternal, unchanging source of truth. Faith and reason help each other. “Reason shows, maintains and protects the truth of the faith.” Faith frees reason from errors and ‘enlightens, strengthens and perfects reason with the knowledge of divine matters’ (Pope Pius IX, <a href="http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius09/p9quiplu.htm" target="_blank"><em>Qui pluribus</em></a>,1846).</p>
<p>Pope Pius taught that therefore it is not true to say that faith in Christ is opposed to human reason or that divine revelation is useless or harmful to man’s perfection (cf. Pius IX, <a href="http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius09/p9syll.htm" target="_blank"><em>Syllabus</em></a>, 6). On the contrary, the Second Vatican Council confirmed that there are two orders of knowledge – faith and reason – and that the Church in no way forbids the faithful to use their reason in human arts and sciences, following the proper methods (cf. <a href="http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html" target="_blank"><em>GS</em></a>, n. 59). The Church encourages the flourishing of human arts and knowledge, recognizing the benefits people derive from them. And the Church knows that study of the world can – by the grace of God – lead people to Him. The only difficult comes when human arts and studies become infected with errors contrary to the Faith, or try to go beyond their own limits and make pronouncements in the realm of faith which lead to confusion (cf.<a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/councils/v1.htm#4" target="_blank"><em> Dei Filius</em></a> ch. 4).</p>
<p>Although faith and reason are not in opposition to one another, and although reason assists our faith, reason and faith are experienced in different ways. Today I would like to talk about the problem or mystery of darkness which accompanies us on our walk in faith. What we believe or know by faith should always somehow make sense; it should never be at war with our reason. But that doesn’t mean that everything we believe is going to be as clear, simple and self-evident as something we can demonstrate scientifically. Faith, after all, deals with “the hidden mysteries of God.” The mysteries of God, which are “revealed to us and accepted by faith,” are so far above the human intellect that “they remain concealed by the veil of faith itself and are as it were wrapped in darkness” (<a href="http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19730705_mysterium-ecclesiae_en.html" target="_blank"><em>Mysterium Ecclesiae</em></a>, n. 5). This does not mean that the mysteries of God are unreasonable or irrational; rather that are <em>supra</em>-reasonable and <em>supra</em>-rational. They are above and beyond our human reason and our human rational capacity. As St. Paul said, now, we see as though through a glass, darkly; that is, we see the things of God as through an indistinct mirror; we see them unclearly (cf. <a class="verseLink 47_13_12_0_0_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=1+corinthians+13:12" target="_blank">1 Cor 13:12</a>).</p>
<p>This reality means that our experience of faith will involve both understanding and darkness. When we exercise our reason “persistently, piously and soberly” in the study of our faith, by God’s gift we will achieve some understanding of the mystery of God. But our reason was made to penetrate the truths of this world; not to penetrate the mysteries of God. The mysteries of God, “by their very nature, so far surpass [our] created human understanding, that even when a revelation has been given and accepted by faith, [those mysteries will] remain covered by a veil…and wrapped…in a certain obscurity….” As long as we are in this mortal life, “we walk by faith, and not by sight” (<a href="http://www.ewtn.com/library/councils/v1.htm#4" target="_blank"><em>Dei Filius</em></a> ch. 4).</p>
<p>We often speak of the light of faith, because faith does, indeed, enlighten our limited reason to realities beyond this world. By the light of faith God’s life is made manifest to us – for example, in the Incarnation, when what appears to be merely man is revealed to be God; or in the Eucharist, when the by the light of faith we discern the Body and Blood of Christ. By the light of faith we can begin to understand God’s design for the world, the truth of human dignity and our eternal destiny.</p>
<p>However, it is also true that faith “is often lived in darkness and can be put to the test. The world we live in often seems very far from the one promised us by faith. Our experiences of evil and suffering, injustice, and death, seem to contradict the Good News; they can shake our faith and become a temptation against it” (<em>CCC</em> 164).</p>
<p>When the light of faith grows dim and we are tested, we must look for support and help by turning to the witnesses of faith, first of all to “the Virgin Mary, who, in ‘her pilgrimage of faith,’ walked into the ‘night of faith’ [by] sharing the darkness of her son’s suffering and death” (<em>CCC</em> 165). Sometimes Mary did not understand the mysteries that were revealed to her. But we can follow her example of “treasuring and pondering these things in our hearts” and abiding in trustful faith in God our Savior (cf. <a class="verseLink 43_2_19_0_0_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=luke+2:19" target="_blank">Lk 2:19</a>).</p>

</p><div class="collapseomatic_content" id="target-id3950">
<p>Often when people speak about what we believe – the content of our faith – they say that it is contrary to our reason. Of course, the Church is aware of this objection to the Faith. It has been answered by the teaching of the popes and by the <em>Catechism</em>. The <em>Catechism</em> teaches that “Faith seeks understanding”: it is natural for someone who believes in God to want to know God better, and to want to understand better what God has revealed. Studying our faith does not result in finding the faith unreasonable. On the contrary, “a more penetrating knowledge will in turn call forth a greater faith, increasingly set afire by love.” …</p>
<p>The great thinker and theologian St. Augustine of Hippo said, ‘I believe, in order to understand; and I understand, the better to believe’ (cf. <em>CCC</em> 158) .</p>
<p>We have to be careful with St. Augustine’s words, when he says “I believe in order to understand.” It may sound like “believing” and “understanding” are two separate actions; that first we have to believe, and only then are we able to understand.</p>
<p>In fact, reason and faith are bound up in one another. They can’t be separated. This is because the human mind has certain principles of reason built into it. For example, even a child before the age of reason is equipped with the precept of cause and effect. A baby somehow “knows” that if it cries, mother will come. Children like magic tricks because they know that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time: a hat cannot be empty and at the same time have a rabbit in it.</p>
<p>Thus everything that we believe – even if we are very young children – comes to us through the means of our rational minds. Dogs and cats and elephants can’t believe anything, because they don’t have a rational mind. It is human to believe because it is human to be reasonable.</p>
<p>Another objection to the faith is that it is contrary to science, or that scientific facts somehow cancel out religious beliefs. But our reason shows us that there is no contradiction between faith and science. The same God who is the author and light of our reason created the material world that is studied by science.</p>
<p>The <em>Catechism</em> eloquently explains that if “methodical research in all branches of knowledge” “is carried out in a truly scientific manner, and does not over-ride moral laws”, it “can never conflict with the faith….” This is because “the things of the world and the things of faith derive from the same God. The humble and persevering investigator of the secrets of nature is being led, as it were, by the hand of God in spite of himself, for it is God, the conserver of all things, who made them what they are” (<em>CCC</em> 159).</p>
<p>In his encyclical “Faith and Reason,” Pope John Paul II warned against an attitude that he called “scientism.” Scientism refuses to accept that there are more kinds of knowledge than just the positive sciences. For someone with this attitude, questions about God, morality, ethics, beauty, and goodness are treated like fantasies that are not worth thinking about (cf. <a href="http://www.vatican.va/edocs/ENG0216/_INDEX.HTM" target="_blank"><em>Fides et ratio</em></a> 88).</p>
<p>Science is limited to the questions of what and how. It cannot answer the questions of why anything should exist; why there should be such things as goodness or beauty; what is the purpose of the universe or the meaning of a man’s life. Futhermore, when a scientist searches for the truth about the material universe, the scientist acknowledges the existence of truth itself, which is not material and cannot be examined under a microscope.</p>
<p>For this reason, John Paul the Second wrote that scientists are well aware that “the search for truth, even when it concerns a finite reality of the world or of man, is never-ending, but always points beyond to something higher than” the object that is being studied.</p>
<p>The search for truth leads us to ask “the questions that give access to Mystery” (<a href="http://www.vatican.va/edocs/ENG0216/_INDEX.HTM" target="_blank"><em>Fides et ratio</em></a> 106). These are questions like, “Where did the world come from? Why is it arranged in this way? What is the purpose of this world? What is my role in it?”</p>
<p>When we believe, we begin to understand the answers to these questions.</p>

</p><div class="collapseomatic_content" id="target-id3025">
<p>A week ago, in our first catechesis, we dwelt on the issue of faith.</p>
<p>Faith is a human act. It plays a vital role in every person’s life. Faith is not only about religion; without faith in other people, humanity cannot grow and survive.</p>
<p>In a General Audience recently, Pope Benedict explained that faith is entrusting ourselves to God. Entrusting ourselves to God gives us a different kind of certainty than the certainty we get from science or mathematics. But it is still a very solid certainty. Faith doesn’t mean just believing certain truths or facts about God. It is an act of entrusting ourselves freely to God, who is our Father and who love us. It means remaining close to that Father who gives us hope and trust (cf. Pope Benedict XVI, General Audience, 24. 10. 2012).</p>
<p>We can also say that faith is two things: it is the act of believing, on the one hand, and it is what we believe, on the other hand. So we can speak of “my faith”, meaning our personal belief in God and our relationship to Him. And we can speak of “the faith”, meaning everything that we believe.</p>
<p>In Mass on Sunday, we repeat the Creed, beginning with the words, “I believe.” But it would be a mistake to think that our faith is merely a personal relationship with Jesus, something that takes place only between each person and God. After the words, “I believe”, we repeat the content of our faith. This content – what we believe – is not the result of private reflection. It came to us through other people. We believe what others have accepted by faith and transmitted to us. This is why Pope Benedict has taught that “Our faith is truly personal, only if it is also communal: it can be my faith only if it dwells in and moves with the ‘we’ of the Church, only if it is our faith, the common faith of the one Church” (Pope Benedict XVI, General Audience, 31. 10. 2012).</p>
<p>We are never alone in our faith. Most of us were baptized into the Faith as children. Our parents, moved by the grace of the Holy Spirit, asked the Church for baptism for us. In most cases, we were baptized during Mass, with the community of faithful as witnesses. Our parents and godparents spoke for us, accepted the faith on our behalf, and promised to instruct us in the faith. In this way we became part of the Church, and entered into the faith of the Church.</p>
<p>From this example of our baptism, we can see that the faith of the Church comes before our individual faith. The faith of the Church “engenders, supports and nourishes our faith. The Church is the Mother of all believers.” To put it simply, “faith is born in the Church, leads to her, and lives in her. This is important to remember” (cf. Pope Benedict XVI, General Audience 31. 10. 12).</p>
<p>Saint Cyprian correctly said that “No one can have God as his Father, who does not have the Church as his Mother.” What does this mean? The <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em> explains that “Salvation comes from God alone; but because we receive the life of faith through the Church, she is our Mother….” Thus the Church is not the author of our Salvation. But we believe the Church as the mother of our new birth. “Because she is our mother, she is also our teacher in the faith” (<em>CCC</em> 169).</p>
<p>From all of this it should be clear that “faith is not an isolated act. No one can believe alone, just as no one can live alone. You have not given yourself faith [just] as you have not given yourself life” (<em>CCC</em> 166).</p>
<p>Sometimes we hear people say that they believe in God, but they don’t believe in the Church. They do not understand that they could never even claim to have faith in God apart from the Church. They treat the Church as something alien, a kind of bureaucratic organization. But the Church is above all a community of believers that stretches back through time all the way to Christ himself. Each generation passed on the faith to the next. This means that our faith makes us part of a living tradition that includes the writings of the saints, the teaching of the ecumenical councils and the popes. All of this is our heritage; all of this is part of our faith. As members of this living tradition of the faith, we need to learn it and pass it on to others.</p>
<p>We need to find the time to read the Scriptures, the decrees of Church councils, the teachings of the popes, and the writings of the saints, because without them, our faith is weak. Let’s not deceive ourselves. If our knowledge of the faith is weak, how can we do our part to pass on the faith to the next generation?</p>
<p>A few generations ago people knew much more of their faith by heart. They could recite parts of the <em>Catechism</em> from memory. They knew all of the responses to the Mass and many hymns. But today, if we didn’t have electricity, not only would our society be disrupted, we would also be unable to practice and pass on our faith, because we remember so little. Therefore it is important that through the grace of God we strive to ensure that we have learned at least the basic truths of our faith by heart. This takes time and commitment to reading and meditation.</p>
<p>True faith seeks understanding. This means that when we really believe, we desire “to know better the One in whom” we have put our faith, “and to understand better what He has revealed.” The deeper our knowledge of God, the greater our faith will be, since it will be “increasingly set afire by love” (cf. <em>CCC</em> 158).</p>

</p><div class="collapseomatic_content" id="target-id1063">
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If you are here in church, it means that you think that the Holy Mass will begin at 4PM.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If you used the tram or the bus to get here, you believed that the driver would not be drunk and he would safely take you to your destination.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If you used your own car, it’s because you believed that it is in good condition and would not break down on the way to church.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If you have eaten your lunch today, it means that you trusted and believed that the foods you bought for the meal were not spoiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If you honor your own parents, it is because you believe that they brought you into this world.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Using these simple examples, we can see that without believing in other people, without trusting and hoping that what others say and do is true, we could not carry on with our lives. If everyone had to stop and personally verify everything other people say and do, the world would cease to grow, and humanity would still be living in a very primitive state.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If we believe what others say; if we accept with credulity the different kinds of information which we hear every day, then it is not strange that we should believe not only that God exists – which the majority of people do believe – but that we should believe what God has said, or as we say in theological language, what God has revealed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church</em> teaches us that by his Revelation, “the invisible God, from the fullness of his love, addresses men as his friends, and moves among them, in order to invite and receive them into his own company.” The adequate response to this invitation is faith” [142].</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Let me repeat the point: God invites us into his own company, and our adequate response to this invitation is faith.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Therefore we cannot say that God’s revelation is not important or useful to us, because it is by means of faith that God wishes to receive us into his own company.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">What is this response of faith? The <em>Catechism</em> explains that “By faith we completely submit [our] intellect and…will to God…. Sacred Scripture calls this human response to God, the author of revelation, “the obedience of faith” [143].</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Simply speaking, to believe is to enter into relationship with God by accepting what He asks or commands. The Bible gives us the example of Abraham, who fulfilled the definition of faith in <a class="verseLink 59_11_1_0_0_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=hebrews+11:1" target="_blank">Hebrews 11:1</a>: “Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen”.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And again in <a class="verseLink 46_4_3_0_0_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=romans+4:3" target="_blank">Romans 4:3</a>: “Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.” Because he was “strong in his faith”, Abraham became the “father of all who believe” [cf. <em>CCC</em> 146].</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">We believe in many things that are unseen. We all believe in gravity, for example, and we rely on it every day. But no one has ever seen gravity. We do not see our thoughts, our will or our imagination, but we experience them every day. We cannot see the future, but we hope for it all the time. We do not see dark matter or dark energy, but we accept on good authority that they exist and have an influence on our existence.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In the realm of faith, when we accept the existence of what is unseen, we accept it on the authority of God.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">At the beginning of this short catechesis I pointed out a few ways in which we put our faith in other people. The <em>Catechism</em> teaches us that “Christian faith differs from our faith in any human person. It is right and just to entrust oneself wholly to God and to believe absolutely what he says. It would be futile and false to place such faith in a creature” [150].</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In other words, it is reasonable and necessary to trust what other people tell us about the world. But it is even more reasonable and necessary to trust absolutely in what we are told by God, who created the world and everyone in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">To sum up:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Believing is “an authentically human act.”</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Believing in God “is possible only by grace and by the interior helps of the Holy Spirit.”</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">“It is not contrary to our dignity to believe what other people tell us about themselves and their intentions, and to trust their promises, as, for example, when a man and a woman marry….”</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If these things are true – and they are true – then it is still less “contrary to our dignity,” to yield to God by faith and the full submission of our intellect and will, so that we might “share in an interior communion with him” [cf. <em>CCC</em> 154].</span></p>
