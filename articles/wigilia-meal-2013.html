<p>On January 20th, about ten people who attend the English Mass gathered at the nearby restaurant called <a href="http://www.karczma-polska.com.pl/" target="_blank">Karczma Polska</a>.  This was the first time the Pastoral Centre has sponsored a communal meal, and we hope it will not be the last.</p>
<p>For most of us – especially those of us from the United States and India – this was the first time we had ever experienced something like the traditional Polish Christmas Eve dinner. Father Krzysztof was in effect both host and Master of Ceremonies, explaining the menu, leading Christmas carols and guiding us through the traditional sharing of the <a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/oplatki/" target="_blank" title="Opłatki">opłatek wafer</a>.</p>
<p>We began with a prayer for the Pastoral Centre and a carol, then we shared opłatki and greetings for the new year. Father Krzysztof said the blessing and we tucked into our first course: clear, slightly sour beetroot soup with dumplings called “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uszka" target="_blank">uszki</a>“, which means “little ears”, because of the shape, not the flavor.</p>
<p>The main course consisted of the traditional Wigilia fried carp, two kinds of salad and mashed potatoes.  Next came large platters of <a href="http://www.tastingpoland.com/food/pierogi.html" target="_blank">pierogi</a> of different sorts.  For most of us, these were often quite new flavors and dishes, so it was something of an adventure in dining, especially when we got to the final dish – a very slightly sweet concoction called <a href="http://easteuropeanfood.about.com/od/polishdesserts/r/kutia.htm" target="_blank">kutia</a>, which – as best as we could figure out – consisted of poppy seeds, wheat grains, honey, sliced almonds and possibly (invisible?) raisins.  This last dish seems to be an acquired taste: some thought it delicious; others thought there was nothing wrong with it that a lot of chocolate couldn’t fix.  But the point is: you’re in Poland, it’s traditional, so you’ve got to try it. And we did.</p>
<p>The restaurant itself is quiet, cosy and pleasant, with good service, and there was talk of going there again in future -maybe for the anniversary of the Pastoral Centre in April? – and testing the rest of the menu.</p>
<p>A big “Thank you” to Fr. Krzysztof for initiating and organizing what may turn into a Pastoral Centre tradition!
