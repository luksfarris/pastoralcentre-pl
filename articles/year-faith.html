<h1><span style="color: #000000;">Opening the Door to the Year of Faith</span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Year-of-faith1.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-683" height="200" src="http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Year-of-faith1.jpg" title="Year of faith" width="270"/></a></span><span style="color: #000000;">With his Apostolic Letter of October 11, 2011, <em>Porta Fidei</em> (<em>Door of Faith</em>), Pope Benedict XVI declared that a “Year of Faith” will begin on October 11, 2012 and conclude on November 24, 2013.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">October 11, 2012, the first day of the Year of Faith, was the fiftieth anniversary of the opening of the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II) and also the twentieth anniversary of the<em> Catechism of the Catholic Church</em>. During the Year of Faith, Catholics are asked to study and reflect on the documents of Vatican II and the <em>Catechism</em> so that they may deepen their knowledge of the faith. One way to do this is to read the Holy Father’s own teachings during the Year of Faith.  The</span> <a href="http://www.vatican.va/special/annus_fidei/index_catechesi_annus-fidei_en.htm" target="_blank" title="Holy Father's Catechesis for the Year of Faith">Holy Father’s Catechesis During the Year of Faith</a> <span style="color: #000000;">is available online.  He gives a new catechesis every seven days from the opening day of the Year of Faith.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In <em>Porta Fidei</em>, the Holy Father began by saying that the “Door of Faith” is always open to us:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">1. The “door of faith” (<a class="verseLink 45_14_27_0_0_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=acts+14:27" target="_blank">Acts 14:27</a>) is always open for us, ushering us into the life of communion with God and offering entry into his Church. It is possible to cross that threshold when the word of God is proclaimed and the heart allows itself to be shaped by transforming grace. To enter through that door is to set out on a journey that lasts a lifetime. It begins with baptism (cf. <a class="verseLink 46_6_4_0_0_3" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NRSVCE&amp;search=romans+6:4" target="_blank">Rom 6:4</a>), through which we can address God as Father, and it ends with the passage through death to eternal life….</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">These words are worth meditating on, especially at the start of a new liturgical year: The Door of Faith is always open to us. We may be hesitating on the threshold, feeling guilty for past sins, afraid to let go of sins or worldly attachments that we feel we can’t live without. We may be afraid of God’s judgement; we may have grown lazy in the faith. We may even feel ashamed of our faith, and not want other people to think of us as “overly religious.”  So we hesistate. We started on the journey at our baptism, but we have only travelled so far, and we are not sure we want to travel further, to move closer to God, to approach Him in the confessional or in the Eucharist. Maybe we are not sure how to take the first step.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">And yet, for all our hesitation, laziness, fear or lukewarmness, we <em>are</em> on that journey of faith.  It began with our baptism, and it <em>will</em> end with our death – and after that, the eternal destiny that our choices have led us to.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The Year of Faith, like Advent, is a time to begin again, to make a new commitment to our Faith, to take a bold step forward in our Faith, trusting in God to show us the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">You don’t have to make a radical transformation of your life. You just have to decide to take the first step.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">So ask yourself now: In your practical, day-to-day life, what can you do to become even better? In your spiritual life, how can you improve?</span></p>
